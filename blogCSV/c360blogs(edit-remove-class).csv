In the last few months, I have seen a sharp rise in the number of trade articles discussing the use of gonzo research. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure why. I recall briefly discussing the term in a market research theory course in college, but that's about the extent of my history with gonzo research. After brushing up on the subject, however, I realize that gonzo might be the next big market research trend.

Most companies think of research in terms of expansive studies commanding monstrous budgets. Not only is this type of research expensive, it can bog down the development process. This leads to many companies forgoing research altogether, which is a mistake brands later regret.

Instead of scaring clients away from research with complex methodologies, consider gonzo research. Like gonzo journlaism, this type of research is subjective and the researcher plays a central role in data collection. Gonzo research is best understood as the most common sense way to answer a research question often through observation.

Consider this example. If a potato chip brand wants to know what product features consumers value most in their preferred brand, they might traditionally conduct a series of focus groups with consumers, including product testing in a controlled environment. To answer the same question with Gonzo research, the brand would simply send a few people into the chip aisles of the local supermarkets and observe their behavior.

The best kind of research provides insights that had previously gone unnoticed. Conducting research on beer? Hang out a bar and take note of the language different types of consumers use when ordering. No matter the subject, you don't need to spend a fortune to get good research. It's all about thinking creatively, which is what gonzo research is about.

So why will gonzo research be the next big thing in marketing research? Well, let's consider our current economic climate. Market research tends to be one of the first places companies look to curb spending. It's easy to see that traditional methodologies will need to adapt. In my opinion, Gonzo research is just the solution the market research industry needs to grow and prosper in the era of the fiscal cliff.

I was loosely following updates on the 2013 CES show in Vegas (thanks to the folks at CNET.) I’ve always found it pretty exciting to peer into the future of what may become common place in our daily lives and think about how these advancements may change the way we create, function and live.

The one that  made my head explode was the <a href=""http://reviews.cnet.com/3D-printers/3D-systems-cubex/4505-33809_7-35567009.html"" target=""_blank"">CubeX 3D printer</a>.

3D printing isn’t really anything new. It’s been around for a few years (which these days seems like an eternity) but until recently, 3D printers have been giant, expensive machines used in industrial prototyping and engineering.

The crazy thing about the CubeX is that it’s designed as a home “desktop 3D printer” (with two &amp; three-color options, I might add). Meaning, you could buy one, take it home and start cranking out your very own 3D creations (assuming you have AutoCAD knowledge, etc... but details, details). Granted they aren’t cheap, but with a starting price of just under $2500, they aren’t unobtainable either.

Like everything else in the tech world, they’re only going to get cheaper. It reminds me of the early days of flat screens HD televisions. The first time I saw one was at the Sony store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. It had a $21K price tag. Fast forward about 10 years later and now you can walk into just about any retailer and pick one up for about $500, if not cheaper. The HD TV of today is also thinner, wider and has a much, much better resolution than the Sony way back in the early 2000’s. The same will certainly happen to 3D printers if -- and when -- they catch on.

Home 3D printing could become as ubiquitous as flat screen televisions. Just imagine how they would change everything about how you buy “stuff.” You’d search on-line, for say a new pair of running shoes, buy the plans, hit print and minutes later go out for a run in your new shoes.

Nike is already producing their <a href=""http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nike-flyknit"" target=""_blank"">Flyknit line</a>, which are essentially “printed” shoes. What’s to say the 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation of 3D home printers couldn’t crank them out on demand? So much for fighting Shelbyville Road traffic or God forbid, waiting for UPS to drop them off at your doorstep a couple of days later. That’s so 2012.

Some online retailers are getting ahead of the curve. Take a look at <a href=""http://www.shapeways.com"" target=""_blank"">Shapeways</a>. For those of us who aren’t ready to plop down $2500, they sell the finished “printed” product. On their site you can buy, or design, custom created objects. They are 3D printed out of polymers ranging from plastics to glass to metal. Up until now, fabricating such fanciful and intricate items would have been a challenge, if not impossible. How’s that for a retail business model? Other than raw materials, 3D printing stores carry no inventory. When an order is placed, print it, box it and ship it.

Done.","How long until 3D printing is being marketed to the general public? ","2013-02-08 06:38:23"
"Pam T","<img alt=""namethatvoiceover"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/namethatvoiceover1.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" />

I’ve been noticing recently the number of commercials that use celebrity voice-overs.  Obviously this is not a new practice, but to me, it seems like it’s happening more and more.  Last week (and probably to the annoyance of my boyfriend) I played “name that voice.”  Every time a commercial came on, I noted the celebrity voice, and of course, made him guess who it was.  Here’s the list I came up with:

Jeff Daniels - <a href=""http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7Ywl/apple-iphone-5-every-picture-tells-a-story-feat-jeff-daniels"" target=""_blank"">iPhone</a>
Lisa Kudrow – <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUU7dwsqi3U"" target=""_blank"">Yoplait</a>
John Krasinski – Blackberry
Julie Bowen – Olive Garden
Mark Paul Gosselar – Turbo Tax
Julia Roberts – Nationwide Insurance
Ed Helms – <a href=""http://Hotels.com/"">Hotels.com
</a>Jason Sudekis –<a href=""http://Hotels.com/""> Applebees
</a>Robert Downey Jr –<a href=""http://Hotels.com/""><a href=""http://Hotels.com/""> Nissan
</a></a>Erin Eckhart – Ford
James Spader – Acura
Paul Giamatti – Liberty Mutual

It made me wonder why the celebrities do it and if it really benefits the company.  For the celebrities, it’s got to be easy money.  It’s only a little bit of time in a recording studio.  As for the products, are people really buying them because they’re being sold by a celebrity?

Personally, I’m not going to rush over to Olive Garden because the lady from Modern Family says it’s great.  My ears do, however, perk up when I realize it’s a voice I know.  And in the end, that does get me to pay attention to the commercial.

Next time you’re sitting in front of the TV see how many voices you can catch.  The big names will surprise you!","Do Celebrities Lending Voice Talent Really Help Brands?","2013-02-15 08:07:54"

Every few days I spend some time searching Vimeo and YouTube for the latest motion graphics reels and examples. I try to pick pieces out of them I find inspiring and work on recreating them for practice. I find this to be a good way to broaden my skill set, get exposure to new techniques, and breakup the sometimes mundane curriculum of tutorials.

Recently, while looking for something to recreate, I stumbled upon Yoplait's latest TV spots. The spots feature two things that naturally go hand in hand, yogurt and motion graphics. And like the brands tag line suggests, these spots are ""so good"".  The spots were created by <a href=""http://lookbook.adage.com/Agencies/Saatchi-Saatchi"">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</a>, New York and feature an array of bright colors and an energy that I found very uplifting. The spots themselves don't appear extremely complex, but the execution on them is second to none. A perfect blend of product placement, motion, and VO.

And after watching 3-4 of them over and over, I had seen enough. I was going to recreate this commercial. All :20 sec of it and document the process along the way. Why you ask? For fame and glory of course and to give you a glimpse of what goes into making yogurt look fun.

Here is the spot I will be recreating:

"Leah","<img alt=""tabletshopping"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tabletshopping.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" />In a <a href=""http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/191092/study-tablet-users-like-to-shop-buy.html#axzz2IGjmQxRh"">recent study by Adobe Systems</a>, tablet owners (55%) were more likely than smartphone users (28%) to use their devices both for shopping and making purchases. This is not a surprising fact, considering tablets usually have a bigger screen for easier viewing, and often mobile pages load faster on tablets than they do on smartphones. However, I wonder how many out of the 1,003 people surveyed had both a tablet and a smartphone? I'm lucky enough to have an iPad and an iPhone but use my iPhone strictly out of convenience. I would be curious to see the numbers divided by brand too (iPad vs. iPhone, Windows tablet vs. Windows phone.)

At any rate, this study shows the importance of retailers deploying a functional mobile site...but how important are apps for retailers? Well, according to this story, very important.  In fact, one in four people are switching to apps for shopping from the Web.

I think retailers are going to have a hard time keeping up, especially when 51% of those surveyed said their number one priority for 2013 was optimizing their main websites and only 43% even had mobile sites or apps in their top three priorities for the year.

"Laura","<img alt=""trafficteamworkshop"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/trafficteamworkshop.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" />

Our traffic team recently attended a workshop called ""Fundamentals of Project Management."" It's great, from time to time, to get back to the basics and revisit some friendly reminders of best practices for traffic in an Agency. I've come up with the Top 3 most important things I learned from the workshop:

1)  Effective project managers act as servants
Your success as a traffic manager depends on your knowledge, attitude &amp; flexibility. You are here to serve others, you should be mission focused, fact-based, results-oriented &amp; have a contingency plan for the unexpected.

2) Make sure you are working on the right project
Before going full force in one direction &amp; being wrong, find out exactly what the client needs. The client gives assumptions that need to be interpreted to find out what the real need is, then the scope of the project can begin. It’s worth the extra time in the beginning if it will help improve the process going forward.

3) Did you know that only 7% of how someone sees us comes from what we say?
38% results from our way of speaking and a whopping 55% (!) of the impression we make on another person comes from non-verbal elements, i.e. body language/visual.","Traffic Best Practices 101","2013-02-20 20:54:43"
"Meredith","<img alt=""AEnewclientcontact"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AEnewclientcontact.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" />

As an Account Executive, I am charged with daily communication with my clients. This generally entails contact with one, perhaps two, key people in the client's organization. Most of the time, this is the head of Marketing. Working with someone like this requires more than just taking notes, making lists and pushing projects through the agency. A key component to successful client service is to build a relationship with my contact. And, after working with the same person for a good length of time, you develop quite a strong tie.  You learn how he/she works, what they like, what they expect from you.  You start to know what they will think before they even think it.  As you grow together professionally, the level of trust increases and you even start to learn things about them personally, which leads to a stronger sense of loyalty and a compulsion to fulfill his/her expectations no matter what.

So, what happens when this person changes positions and I get a new point of contact? Anxiety!  It's really as if we just got a new client.   A million nervous thoughts run through my mind!  Who is this person? What is their background? What will they think of us?  Will they like our style of work?  Will they like me? AHHHH!

I have recently gone through my first experience with this.  While it's been a scary one, I decided to take it on with confidence and in turn, realized there was nothing to worry about.  I have never done this before, so wasn't sure what exactly to expect.   I keep reminding myself to treat them like a new client and WOW them.   I am happy to report that so far, it appears to be going really well!  It really couldn't have been better, although I will definitely miss my former contact like crazy.  It is nice to have a fresh set of eyes and fresh mind working with us on the account!","Handling a client switch like a pro","2013-02-22 12:01:51"

How do you like to spend your lunch? Maybe you meet up with friends? Maybe you have meetings through lunch? I bet you don't dance in a club for an hour.

In Sweden, a new lunch revolution is taking over. In 2010, fourteen friends danced their lunch break away in their office garage. Word spread and now the whole country is beginning to participate in ""lunch discos."" There are rules that must be obeyed if a lunch disco is to take place. For example, there can be no drugs or alcohol, and work CANNOT be talked about. This time is used to help relieve stress and forget about work for 60 minutes while you dance to the rhythm of the beats the DJ is playing. This exercise is said to help stimulate creativity and increase productivity when you return to work. According to this <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201202/the-neuroscience-imagination"">psychology</a> article aerobic exercise and sleep are the two best things for stimulating creativity.

But back to lunch discos. Where does lunch come in?

At the end of 60 minutes there is a takeaway lunch and drink (non-alcoholic). Maybe here at Current360 we should start having our own lunch discos in Studio Nulu. Our very own DJ Jimmy D could spin us some jams.

Recently, the LIVE<b>STRONG</b> Foundation – formerly known as the Lance Armstrong Foundation – unveiled a new logo to create distance between the disgraced cyclist and the nonprofit organization dedicated to helping those living with cancer.

LIVE<b>STRONG</b> Foundation Exec VP-Operations Andy Miller explained the new look like this: “The change is subtle, but it is substantive. The positioning of the bars suggests forward and dynamic movement.”

You can certainly make an argument that, from a design standpoint, this is a natural step in the mark’s evolution. But is it enough to accomplish the Foundation’s main goal?

At first glance, it’s hard to ignore that the brand tied so closely with Lance Armstrong for past 9 nine years has decided to move forward using the same bright yellow color he made famous worldwide.

Even more perplexing is the fact that the Foundation has chosen to continue bolding the STRONG portion of their name.

I understand that the LIVE<b>STRONG</b> name and color are highly recognizable, which is critically important with so many nonprofits and charitable organizations competing for the same dollar. And the addition of the word Foundation to the outward facing name does help to take the focus off a single person.

But wouldn’t it have made more sense – and immediately signaled a change in direction – to bold LIVE instead of STRONG? Isn’t living with cancer what the foundation is all about, anyway? Or, if that’s too dramatic of a change, they could have just treated the entire name the same without bolding anything at all.

Also, would anyone have blamed the LIVE<b>STRONG </b>Foundation for adopting a different color than that same bright yellow? Even a simple change in the shade of yellow would have helped to convey that the Foundation had evolved.

It may be impossible to ever fully separate the nonprofit’s name with the person who has been synonymous with it for nearly a decade. But these initial actions by the LIVE<b>STRONG </b>Foundation do little to help people see the organization as an independent entity that has moved on from Lance Armstrong.","Can LIVESTRONG break the cycle?","2013-03-05 13:29:38"

American Idol premiered to lower than anticipated ratings, especially given the Mariah vs. Nicki drama that viewers were anticipating. The premiere rating for A18-49 nationally was a 6.0, down 19% from last season’s debut. In fact, this season was the second lower premiere from the series. When was the lowest? 2002, before Idol blew up and Kelly Clarkson become America’s sweetheart, with a 4.8 rating.  To be fair, even though there has been some slippage in its dominance, Idol still beat the three other networks combined in the first hour.  CBS and NBC were airing reruns, though.

What has caused the ratings dip?  It could be a lack of talent or maybe viewers miss the Simon-Randy-Paula combination but I don't think either is the case.  When Idol launched, it was a unique concept.  Now, 11 years later, we've got The Voice, The X Factor and America's Got Talent to compete with.  And most of these shows, along with Idol, are on for multiple nights each week. That's a lot of hours to watch people sing, no matter how exceptional the talent pool is.

The question that looms for media buyers and advertisers this season is, is American Idol still a good buy? I say if the target demo fits and you have the budget, then yes it is. A 6.0 rating isn't shabby and keep in mind that's a household number.  For certain demos, such as W18-34, the numbers are higher and viewers are extremely loyal.

While I believe American Idol will be around for several more seasons, eventually all good things must come to an end. Perhaps there will be another few seasons left or perhaps it will follow the path of The Real World and we'll await the premiere of Season 28.","Is American Idol still an Idol?","2013-03-12 08:55:03"

Fashion week may be over but a new designer is quickly ramping up to debut a new line. If you're a fashion diva like myself you may be wondering how you could've possibly missed this latest installment in the fashion world. Are you sitting down? You may need to be sitting to take in the information I'm about to give you.

The United States Postal Service is partnering with The Wahconah Group out of Cleveland to produce an apparel and accessories line.

Is your mind blown?

The new line's brand name will be ""Rain Heat &amp; Snow"" going along with their motto ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat no gloom of night stay these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."" The new clothing line will not be uniforms for the U.S. Postal Services's employees but a clothing line for the masses. I believe it to be along the lines of a durable, weather proof kind of line that may be comparable to Carhartt. The fashion partners also hope to incorporate accessories that will have electronic devices embedded into them. The menswear line is being produced first and a women's line will be launched later.

The announcement comes after the U.S. Postal Service announced a net loss of 1.3 billion in the first quarter this year. It's also estimated that they lose nearly 25 million dollars a day. This is definitely a big move away from their core competency and I'm not sure this is the best way to save the company or try to survive in this economy. The U.S. Postal Service has also notified the public that they will be ending Saturday delivery in August of 2013. They believe this will help recoup about 2 billion dollars but will it be enough to keep them afloat? It makes much more sense for the U.S. Postal Office to branch out into the FedEx or UPS type business instead of the fashion industry. When I envision what the U.S. Postal Services line will look like I can't help worrying that they'll stick to the light blue, navy and gray color palette. I hope they prove me wrong.

After reading about the U.S. Postal Service branching out, I couldn't help but wonder what other brand expansion faux pas had occurred. Another example of a company expanding outside their realm of expertise is Zippo's. We all know that they are the maker of lighters but they decided to venture into women's perfume in 2012. In my opinion, their first mistake was plunging into the perfume business and their second mistake was creating the perfume bottle to resemble a lighter. Not only do you think of smelling like smoke if you use this perfume but you also carry the risk of potentially picking up the wrong ""lighter."" Some brands can expand seamlessly into other areas such as Virgin. They've broken into the airplane, train and music business, however, other companies have not been as successful.

Who would've ever imagined that the U.S. Postal Service would create Ready to Wear (RTW) for the American people? They may be successful in their new business venture but only time will tell. You can guarantee that I'll be checking in on the status of this line and finding a carrier near me!

VW produced a nice commercial about a week before Super Bowl. It started with infamous YouTube clips (most of which I'm sure everyone but me has seen before), followed by uplifting music performed on a sunny hillside by none other than reggae legend Jimmy Cliff (who introduced reggae music to the western world, even before Bob Marley). Jimmy Cliff has given us songs like Many Rivers to Cross, The Harder they Come, Sitting Here in Limbo and Rivers of Babylon.

The people in the YouTube clips were then shown gathered with Cliff on a grassy slope waving their arms and getting what they always wanted (cats and glitter mostly), while being serenaded about being happy.

Oddly enough, the brand, Volkswagen, was not shown until the last few seconds of the spot. It was nice to not be bombarded with logos and overt messaging from start to finish. The majority of the spot had nothing to with cars – it was pretty much just asking people to pay attention and get happy.

This spot got my attention and I thought it was entertaining. I hope more companies will aim to show me things that I like and lure me in with good music. I like the idea of getting primed to accept what they are selling. Or at least keep my attention long enough to see what they are selling.","Get in. Get happy. With Volkswagen.","2013-03-13 20:52:23"

As a professional lover of ice cream, I take notice when there are new or different items in my grocers freezer aisle. So, it’s only appropriate that I noticed Walgreens has rebranded its premium ice cream packaging. (Please note: Walgreens is not my grocer, but a girl needs a quick trip for some snack-age every once in a while).

Good &amp; deLish is Walgreen’s retail brand that includes pints of premium ice cream. The new packaging consists of a few different flavors all having completely black backgrounds with mainly white type masked into a shape.

To be honest, I’m not a big fan of the new redesign. I understand that they were trying to create a more premium look by adding a script font onto an elegant black background (because script font and black = sophistication, right?), but I’m not sure they really thought about their target audience. We are ice cream lovers and ice cream is fun and messy. No one eats ice cream with their pinky finger raised. Am I right or am I right?

The new packaging does have some fun copywriting like “Udderly Vanilla” and a cute concept by masking the type into a star (Strawberry Cheesecake Starlet) or guitar (Cookie Dough and Peanut Butter Duet) shapes, but it doesn’t grab my attention. Some of the script font is difficult to read. Not to mention, in a darker freezer, it might be hard to read or even notice the black pints.

All in all, the rebranding just gives me cold chills. I worry this packaging design isn’t going to get customers to pull this pint out of the freezer. Hopefully the contents inside the pint are better than the design on the outside.","No One Eats Ice Cream With Their Pinky Finger Raised","2013-03-14 05:42:48"

Recently, a blog was posted on the <b>Current</b>360 website discussing the virtues and vices of the “Kentucky for Kentucky” tourism video.   The unsanctioned video, created by three ad men from Lexington, was a proud celebration of the commonwealth’s “awesomeness” and their rebuttal to the state’s official slogan “Unbridled Spirit.”  The irreverent campaign has since garnered national exposure for the bluegrass state including mentions in the <i>L.A. Times</i> and <i>Ad Age</i>.

The very next day in Fort Lauderdale, the location of <b>Current</b>360’s South Florida office, an article ran in the <i>Sun Sentinel</i> that the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau would kick off its 2013 campaign with a free skate party in NYC’s Rockefeller Center adorned with palm trees and beach umbrellas.   A glass-enclosed beach-on-wheels would also wind its way through the city as scantily clad dancers grooved to beach music and frolicked, much to the envy of those on the very frigid outside looking in.   Since then, Fort Lauderdale’s “Goodbye Chilly.  Hello Sunny” tour has made its way to London and Chicago as documented on the <a href=""http://pinterest.com/visitlauderdale/goodbye-chilly-hello-sunny/"" target=""_blank"">campaign’s Pinterest board</a>.

Both campaigns should be celebrated for their ability to generate buzz.   Thanks to social media and the blogosphere, remarkable campaigns such as these can get much more mileage from buzz than they can from ad spend.  For those wise enough not to get hung up on the “Kentucky Kicks Ass” tagline, “Kentucky for Kentucky” has fostered a well-deserved sense of pride in the uniqueness of the area and its people.   This pride is no doubt turning everyday residents into ambassadors.

And. for those people who are not bitterly jealous or frostbitten the “Goodbye Chilly. Hello Sunny” campaign instills in them a strong desire to trade in their galoshes and gloves for swimsuits and sun screen.   See you on the beach!","Create a Buzz if you want the Biz","2013-03-15 08:33:51"

Most folks would agree that it’s natural/logical to believe that more expensive products are superior to their lesser expensive counterparts. I’m certainly guilty of it. After all, if a product costs more, it must be because it’s made better, will last longer — or in the case of wine — because it tastes better, right?

Not so fast.

In 2008, <a href=""http://www.caltech.edu/content/wine-study-shows-price-influences-perception"" target=""_blank"">a study</a> was conducted by the California Institute of Technology and Stanford University to determine how consumers evaluate expensive wines versus cheaper wines.

The study required student volunteers to taste wine samples, which were identified by different price points of $10, $35, $45 and $90 per bottle. The wines were divided into pairs ($10 vs $90 and $35 vs $45 per bottle), and the subjects were asked to compare and grade each. As the subjects tried the wines, their brains were scanned using an MRI machine, which measured activity in their frontal cortexes, or pleasure centers.

When the subjects were told the prices of the wines <i>before</i> tasting, they reliably graded pricier wines more favorably than cheaper ones. Interestingly, the MRI readings also revealed more brain activity in the subjects’ pleasure centers as they sampled the more expensive selections.

But here’s the twist: The samples were actually the same wine.

The subjects were brought back eight weeks later to taste the wines again — this time <i>without</i> price cues. And sure enough, with no price information on which to base their beliefs, the subjects showed no definitive preference for any of the wines.

The wine study clearly illustrates the power that price points have on influencing consumer beliefs. (Similar arguments have been made about product packaging and <a href=""http://www.beveragedaily.com/Processing-Packaging/Surprising-wine-label-study-shows-brands-should-speak-to-Chinese"" target=""_blank"">other superficial factors</a>.) Nevertheless, the study reveals an interesting phenomenon that raises the question: Why don’t all brands just inflate their prices to enhance the perceived quality of their products?

Because it’s not that simple.

Effectively wielding the <i>Pricebo Effect, </i>as I’ve cornily coined it, is tricky: McDonald’s can’t get away with selling $15 hamburgers; Wal-Mart can’t get away with selling $10,000 earrings; and if Miller High Life cost $8 a bottle, I wouldn’t be downing a 12-pack each night. (Conversely, boutique brands like Mercedes-Benz can’t sell $15,000 sedans, and Rolex can’t hawk $50 watches.)

The bottom line? Higher price points have the power to increase consumers’ perceptions about product quality, but ONLY if it’s right for the product and right for the brand.

The MRI wine study provides some captivating insights into how consumers equate price with quality — even at the brain-chemistry level. And it proves that brands can strategically use higher price points to increase consumer favorability — but <i>only</i> if the price is right.

So what gives? Does this ring true for you? Have you ever been seduced by a high price point? Do tell.","The Pricebo Effect: Considering the Power of the Price Point in Shaping Consumer Beliefs","2013-03-19 07:09:01"

When you’re doing improv comedy, everything you perform on stage is completely made up on the spot. However, as I mentioned in <a href=""http://current360.com/play/improv-in-the-agency-the-a-to-c-lesson/"" target=""_blank"">my last blog</a>, we improvisers have a few tricks we use to help spark ideas. A-to-C thinking helps improvisers come up with unusual twists inside their own mind that can send the audience for a loop. However, there are other devices (in improv, we often call them “games”) that might actually help clue in the audience (and our scene partners) as to the comedic direction of the scene. One such game is called the Snowball Effect.

Whether you knew it was called the snowball effect or not, you most certainly know this comedy bit. Most recently, it was used in this hilarious series of commercials for DirectTV:

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7udQSHWpL88"" height=""240"" width=""400"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

It’s the basic concept of the snowball analogy — a small problem that, as time and other factors weigh in, gets bigger and bigger until it is a serious (or in our case, seriously absurd) problem.

Once we’ve seen one iteration of DirectTV’s campaign, we already <i>know</i> what the punchline is going to be when the second ad airs.

One of the things that makes ads great is an element of surprise, but the very opposite —predictability — can be what makes ad campaigns great. It’s the same way in improv. Audience’s love the feeling of knowing the jokes before they even happen. And nothing is more satisfying to the improviser (or the brand) than giving their audience exactly what they want.","Improv in the Agency: The Snowball Effect","2013-03-21 07:15:04"

Recently while perusing the web trying to break through an ongoing blog brain block I came across a site called <a href=""http://idsgn.dropmark.com/107"" target=""_blank"">Choose Your Ipsum</a>.  I’ve never looked forward to my next opportunity to place dummy copy as I now do.  Usually when I need some filler Lorem ipsum copy, I just have some random paragraphs generated from some random site, but no more.  No more boring filler copy.  This site is chock full of fun new twists on the old boring Lorem ipsum. I’m just going to list a few examples with a small sample of copy:

<strong>Chuck Norris Ipsum</strong>

Chuck ipsum. Chuck Norris went looking for a bar but couldn’t find one. He walked to a vacant lot and sat there. Sure enough within an hour an a half someone constructed a bar around him. He then ordered a shot, drank it, and then burned the place to the ground. Chuck Norris yelled over the roar of the flames, “always leave things the way you found em!” Chuck Norris sold his soul to the devil for his rugged good looks and unparalleled martial arts ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Chuck roundhouse kicked the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn't stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming.

<strong>Beer Ipsum</strong>

Today was the first time I’ve ever read Dummy copy and laughed out loud.  Even if you don’t need any Lorem ipsum copy it’s still a good read.

Music not only reflects what mood a person is in but it also is a great tool to alter a person's mood. During positive mood intervals, music can help a person express happiness externally for others to see. When someone is in a bad mood, music can help a person by allowing that internal stress to be released, allowing for a more pleasant state.

Another way to relieve stress is to become proactive. With the responsibility of running traffic for an agency, a person must learn to deal with individuals, and not just tasks. By learning how each individual functions, a good traffic manager can reduce stress for the person, themselves, and those that are further down the process chain.

A third way to manage stress is one that is understated and often an assumption by others. Learning more about each client and understanding both the client, their past, and the direction their marketing is taking will help to better traffic the tasks related. If the trafficker understands where the projects have been and where they are going, that person can better fill in gaps and translate all current issues, thus releasing or reducing the stress  for all parties involved.","Stress Management Techniques for a Traffic Manager","2013-03-18 15:47:54"

What is a person with a Business Marketing degree doing talking specifics about web development, creative design and video production?

This has become the exciting challenge of the ever-dynamic account services life at Current360. Myself, a Business Marketing graduate from Transylvania University, a liberal arts university, continuing the “holistic approach” to education from college to my workplace.

In building a full-service agency with little need to outsource, Current360 has created a ripe atmosphere for these vastly different, yet highly collaborative disciplines to interact and work together on a daily basis. Whether from a formal internal meeting kicking off a project or sitting at the large studio table during lunch, these different departments and different minds are brainstorming, interacting, creating solutions, talking of their interests,or just sharing some laughs. In this “liberal arts-minded” workplace, we all benefit from exposure to the field of studies we know less about. The opportunity to share cross-departmental knowledge is frequent, and in this environment, I can truly say I learn something new every day.

Furthermore, these different departments attract diverse people with differing backgrounds accompanied by various assortments of educations and professional experience. This fosters a more well-rounded professional that is able to communicate and work together with a team of individuals of various talents and skills to reach a common goal.

In the end, it’s the variety of expertise that Current360 has nourished, and that is the backbone of our creativity and allows us to say, “We Do That.”","Current360 is an Ace at Teaching Employees to be Jacks of All Trades","2013-03-26 05:50:43"

If you’re an active member of the Twitterverse, you’ve had that self-gratifying moment when someone publicly agrees with you and rewards you with the coveted re-tweet. Twitter is the biggest conversation in the world and with everyone speaking at once, getting a direct response from someone across the room can be a big deal – especially when they’re your favorite celebrity, athlete or brand.

Yes. A lot of verified accounts out there are run by of PR managers and lawyers, but some of them are the real deal – and that’s cool. Just like businesses and national brands, figures of popular culture have harnessed Twitter to purvey their image at their leisure. They can freely monitor what people say about or to them and choose to respond or ignore as they wish. Being a proactive Twitter user can have very positive side effects when done right.

Brands and celebrities know that by responding and interacting with followers, they just might convert some followers to brand ambassadors. Whether they’re responding to a disgruntled consumer or making small talk with a fan, it helps. At worst, at least followers know you’re human and are listening.

I strolled around our office and asked some of our Twitter-savvy light bulbs to brag about their proudest reply, re-tweet or follow. I’ve got to say, we’ve compiled a pretty impressive A-list around here, including a re-tweet from Erin Andrews of ESPN for our very own @bradluttrell and even a follow from the Turtleman for @leahmxoxo. If our Twitter interactions were a party, we’d have to host it on a different night than the Grammy’s just so everyone could be there. Alright, exaggeration, but check out some of the Twitter users out there who are listening and share your coolest interactions with us in the comments.

This week, there's no way you could've missed the thousands of consumers showing their support of marriage equality by replacing their profile pictures on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest with a red equals sign. If you're wondering, this is an icon based on the Human Rights Campaign equality symbol with shades of red instead of blue and yellow on their personal Facebook page.  The movement began this past Tuesday in response to the Supreme Court convening to decide the fate of marriage equality, and more specifically, the fate of Proposition 8, which outlawed same-sex marriages in California.

But individuals are not the only ones supporting the cause, many major American brands and corporations are getting on board and throwing their support around LGBT and marriage equality.

Two vodka brands, Absolut and Smirnoff, led the charge in what might be called ""equality branding."" Absolut Vodka vowed ""Absolut Support"" in an ad Tuesday and their competitor claimed ""Every Pairing Is Perfect,"" displaying an ad with three different red drink pairings.

In another instance, Bud Light, as meant to be a show of support, tweeted and posted on Facebook an image of an equal sign made up of Bud Light cans. Bud Light’s support for equality isn’t unique in the American business community. NPR reported Monday that 278 businesses had signed on to a brief asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, including recognizable companies like Nike, Apple, Starbucks, and Citigroup.

Equality branding has not only been limited to social media. Companies are using television advertising to broaden their support for marriage equality, too. Recently Amazon released a television ad for their reading tablet, the Kindle, which shows straight and gay couples bonding on vacation.

Expedia ran a commercial that tells the story of a man's journey through the same-sex wedding of his daughter who lives across the country. It tells of his struggle and ultimate acceptance of his daughter as a lesbian.

Sorry, fellow agency friends, this entry isn't for you. It's for those of you who want to issue an RFP – public and private sectors alike.

You can get the most out of your potential agency partners if you're willing to create a little healthy competition amongst the crowd. A little secret about agency folks - we are EXTREMELY competitive. Use that to your advantage!

Follow a few simple guidelines to find the best partner:

1. First, issue a Request for Information. Make it fairly short and basic – you want to find out the size of the agency, some of its other clients and whether they are equipped to handle your business. For example, if your budget is $10,000 and one of the agencies has annual revenues of $100 million, it's likely you won't get the attention you need and deserve because your budget makes you low man on the totem pole.

You can also ask some non-traditional questions that will paint a good picture of what kind of people you'll encounter. I like <a href=""http://www.findingbetteragencies.com/2012/12/bust-out-of-the-agency-rfi-rutt.html"" target=""_blank"">this approach</a> on the RFI.

2. Second, the actual RFP. The ultimate goal is, again, to determine which finalist is the best fit for your organization's needs. You can easily separate the wheat from the chaff with a few simple questions you can ask of your candidates:

- How important am I to your business? [In other words, am I the smallest client, the largest client, or somewhere in between? Will they need to hire to handle your business or are they ready as is?]

- What is different about you? [Most agencies will say the same things – amazing creative, we treat you like family, we're new/hip or we're established/reliable – none of that matters if those things do not meet your needs.]

- I have an RFP budget of $2,000 for you to develop a spec campaign for our new product. I will pay you for your time, whether we select you or not. If you're selected, the budget for this project will be $500,000. [Let me be clear here – I AM suggesting that you should invest $6,000 – $2,000 each for 3 finalists – in the RFP process. The agencies will be invigorated by this. You'll get tremendously better work out of them. And you'll own the ideas too.

3. Third, give the finalists 4 weeks to develop their plans. Time produces deep thought and effective strategic thinking. And then have them in for live presentations and Q&amp;A. You won't believe the part chemistry plays in agency selection. Do you like them? Do you think they listen well? Do they read between the lines well? Are they open to your ideas?

4. Finally, make your decision and notify the winner first. Then, call each non-winner with a prepared set of talking points about why they did not win your account. Be honest. That's the fair thing to do. We are all dying to know if we're going to have the honor of helping you, especially after putting so much work into the pitch.

There was one RFP a few years ago that I thought was deployed and handled perfectly. While we weren't selected, I understand why and have no negative feelings about it – well, other than being bummed about not getting to do great work for good people!","How to Succeed at the RFP Process","2013-04-10 05:05:56"
"Charity","<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/finalfour.jpg""><img alt=""finalfour"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/finalfour.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" /></a>

The Final Four is set. Fans of Louisville, Syracuse, Michigan and Wichita State are doing everything they can to support their team in the championship stretch. For many, that means shelling out for commemorative Final Four apparel.

My husband Ben, a big time Cards fan, was particularly excited at the opportunity to finally get some Nike brand UofL shirts. That’s because during the regular season, all uniforms, shoes and official fan gear for Louisville is made exclusively by Adidas. And, at least to Ben, it’s common knowledge that Nike is way cooler than Adidas.

It started to make me wonder…how did Nike get to be the coolest brand in college sports?

I’m sure there’s a lot more to it than this, but back in the mid 1990s, Nike started the trend of paying big bucks to universities for an exclusive partnership with their athletic programs. In the agreements, the schools get tons of pricey gear for their student athletes (and quite a bit of cash for themselves) and brands get the inherent publicity of having the world’s future sports professionals decked out in their logos. As a result of some of those early deals, Nike was able to capture the loyalty of promising players and keep it once they’ve become full blown superstars.

But it’s more than just star power. Nike also has earned the reputation of being the most innovative in terms of performance and, more importantly, style.

Brands like Adidas and Under Armour have been working their tails off — designing, marketing and spending a ton of money — to catch up. In my opinion, they’ve made some real progress. Adidas puts a lot of effort into their throwback and retro designs, and while that may not appeal much to the 17-year-old recruit, they’ve also been taking risks with some cutting edge styles. If their bright, camouflage-looking tournament uniforms for 2013 didn’t strike a chord with Kansas or Notre Dame prospects, perhaps they will with Louisville or Michigan fans…if one of those two schools takes the crown this weekend.

But for now, for lots of basketball fans, Nike is still the king of cool. And during tournament time, when the licensing of fan apparel is open game, you can bet they’ll be cashing in on their chance to snag a few bucks from Louisville <i>and</i> Nike brand loyalists like Ben!","The Basketball Brand Battle","2013-04-05 09:58:34"

Every night of the week right around 7:30 I can pretty much guarantee that I will be just about to begin reading or be reading stories with my oldest son Isaac. This is how it’s been for the past few years. We pick out a few stories and crawl into bed, snuggle down and read. This is one of my favorite things in the world.

Over time I’ve become familiar with quite a few different children’s books. Some I remember from my childhood, which can evoke a strange sort of deja vu, and some that are as new to me as they are to Isaac. What triggers my strongest and most vivid memories within each book are the illustrations. Somewhere between childhood and having a child, I had forgotten what a great source of illustration children’s books are.

I’ve always been interested in illustration, and children’s books are pretty much illustrations with a sprinkling of copy. I think we may even have a few books that have only one or two sentences at the most.

Isaac and I have read a ton of good stories, but some really stand out to me, and I think it’s because it’s paired with good illustrations.
Here are a few of my favorites.

The Story of Ferdinand

I think the Everything Goes books are Isaac’s favorites. Biggs books are jam packed with illustrations of thing flying and driving and sailing even more than the pages in a Richard Scarry book. What kid wouldn’t love that.

This has some of my favorite illustrations ever. they are just awesome!

All of these stories are just the tip of the iceberg. Every week we read a new batch of books full of great illustrations, some that bring back a memory of long ago and some complete new to me that create a whole new memory that is shared between Isaac and me. Maybe one day, eons from now, Isaac will experience this same nostalgic feeling just by seeing an illustration in a book.

I have a feeling that this same thing happens to millions of mothers and fathers everyday. They snuggle in close to their little ones and begin to read a story filled with illustrations that bring back memories of being in a similar warm safe place as there mother or father read to them as they stare sleepily at the illustration that fills the page and brings the book to life. Is there a book full of illustrations that brings back great memories for you?","Illustrations drive a core emotion: nostalgia","2013-04-12 21:26:30"

One or my favorite companies just had a HUGE product recall.  Yes, I know companies have recalls all the time on products but how the company responds is the big task.

Lululemon makes athletic gear for yoga, running and working out.  Most would say it is a tad on the pricey side, BUT they are comfortable, cute and manufacture under the highest quality standards.  (Well, had been great quality).   I own several Lulu pieces and have never had an issue.  I have had pieces for years and they still look new.  I LOVE them.  Ask my husband. The clothes can be used for workout but also can be worn when I am running errands, want to be comfy, but not look like a bum.

The recall is on their yoga pants, which I believe is one of their best sellers.   They recalled 17% of the on-shelf product because of excessive sheerness.    A spokesperson for Lulu said, “The ingredients, weight and longevity qualities of the women’s black luon bottoms remain the same but the coverage does not, resulting in a level of sheerness in some of our women’s black luon bottoms that fall short of our very high standards.”  She then went on to say that they were looking into the issue.

Since the recall, as anything else big, it has gone viral and people are non-stop talking about it.  It was even on the Today Show.  Their stock fell almost 6% since.  And all they have really said other than the statement above is, ""We will offer full refunds to anyone who has purchased pants with this material.""

But, is that enough?  I guess if you are a true Lulu lover it may be, but if you are a occasional Lulu/occasional Nike/occasional Adidas buyer, would it be?  I am a Lulu lover and still feel like there is a missing piece here.  I need a little more from them. I need something to reassure me that it won't happen again.  But what is that reassurance, I ask myself...  Is it just their word, is it more than that?

How do you think it should be handled?","Lululemon Recall: Reassure Me Please!","2013-04-15 07:40:56"

One of my favorite fun things we do here at C360 is Current Movie Night. It's something we started nearly 10 years ago with a once-a-year Halloween Movie Night and has evolved into a 3- or 4-times-a-year get together where we project a movie on our giant cyc wall, have trivia contests and enjoy lots of drinks and salty snacks. It's a great way to blow off some steam, enjoy each others' company and it makes for a cheap date night. And while we take suggestions for movies to screen, the picks often come from somebody young on the staff saying they have never seen someAnimal House or The Godfather.

One of the fun things that has evolved form our movie nights is the invitations. What started as an email has turned into a bit of a running gag using the movie poster, but with a Current360 twist, usually in the form of somebody getting photoshopped into said movie poster. The photoshop usually isn't that great (every minute is a billable minute), but it's usually good for a laugh. We've done everything from our President, Rick Schardein as Don Corleone, to VP of Emerging Media, Katy Miller, as Evil Ed from Fright Night.

When I sent the invite around this morning for upcoming next movie night, Donovan said ""you should put together a little gallery of these posters,"" and I thought it would make for a fun blog topic.

So here are 5 of my favorites:

<strong>1. Return of the Living Dead</strong>

This was our first movie night and the first time we did a formal email invitation. (And I use the word ""formal"" most loosely.) Not a great movie. Not even a good movie. In fact, it's so bad that it is entertaining. And it's set in Louisville, so there's that. In the image is Katy Miller with her old hairstyle, Tech Wiz Anthony Bouvier with a radical punk hairstyle and yours truly, with the same hairstyle I've had since my freshman year in college.

&nbsp;

<strong>2. 300 at Bakery Square</strong>

Lots of ""This! Is! Current!"" jokes going around that week. This was one of the first non-Halloween movies we did and that's our Creative Director Dennis Bonifer as the villainous Xerxes. Dennis winds up in a lot of these parodies, mostly because, with a shaved head, he's really fast and easy to clip out in Photoshop. And he's a good sport.

&nbsp;

<strong>3. The Social Network</strong>

Another appearance by our Head Geek, The Bouv, in a send up of the Jessie Eisenberg poster from the film.  It's also the only time we bothered to take a new photo of someone for one of these invites. It's tough to find an existing photo of someone staring soullessly into the camera, Zuckerberg-style, so we had to let Anthony in on the design beforehand.

&nbsp;

<strong>4. Jaws</strong>

Our most recent Halloween movie and one of my all-time favorites. Also one of the first invitations not to have a member of the Current 360 Players in the image. (Mostly because adding people becomes a little time consuming.) But if I could have figured out a way to make Dennis that Shark, I totally would have.

<strong>5. Django Unchained</strong>

And finally, here's the image for our next movie night, which incorporates our new logo into a Saul Bass-inspired color block poster.

And as an added bonus, here's one of the trivia sheets form our Jaws/Zombieland double feature. Enjoy.

We listen to a lot of music in the art studio at C360. We're lucky to work in an environment where we can turn up the radio on most days and in doesn't hinder anyone from doing their work. If anything, it probably helps. And when we aren't listening to WFPK, we will ""go to the iPod"" and run playlists from different people's iTunes libraries. I've often tweeted when we put together unusual playlists for special events: a ""Breakup Songs"" list for our disillusioned single staffers on Valentine's Day, a ""rain"" playlist for a particularly monsoonish morning, or a ""famous drunks"" playlist when Randy Travis gets arrested. (This happens more often than it should, Randy!)

More often that not, I'll post a screen shot on Twitter or take suggestions on Facebook, and inevitably, someone will reply with a request to share the list so people outside our campus can enjoy the music. So I thought I'd take a shot at doing just that: regularly sharing playlists from the Studio iTunes library, via this blog and Spotify.

The first one up is kind of an odd one, but one that I was really excited to put together. Recently our sister company, Studio Nulu, hosted a fundraising event for a very special little girl named Miley, and I was asked to put together music appropriate for a 5-year-old girl's ""prom."" (You can find out more about Miley and her event <a title=""Miley's Prom"" href=""http://insiderlouisville.com/news/2013/03/06/fundraiser/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.) It's not really music that is in my wheelhouse, but I took a shot at it. Here's the playlist for Miley's prom.

In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last couple years, Pantone (“the authority on color”) has been spreading its brand to the non-design world. Everything from Pantone <a title=""Flower Pots"" href=""http://www.jeremyriad.com/blog/design/pantone-flower-pots/"" target=""_blank"">flower pots</a>, <a title=""Coffee Mugs"" href=""http://www.popdeluxe.net/pa.html"" target=""_blank"">coffee mugs</a>, <a title=""Christmas Ornaments"" href=""http://www.jeremyriad.com/blog/design/pantone-christmas-balls/"" target=""_blank"">christmas ornaments</a>, and even <a title=""Edibles"" href=""http://www.jeremyriad.com/blog/art/3d/edible-pantone-tarts/"" target=""_blank"">edibles</a>! So why not expand to wearables, or should I say ""underwearables""?

So that's exactly what South African design studio, <a title=""Mark"" href=""http://themarkwebsite.co.za/"" target=""_blank"">Mark</a>, did! The Cape Town creative agency recently mocked up Underpantones—underwear that come in various Pantone colors. They're intended for both men and women, and each pack is helpfully labeled with the color's swatch number. This concept for Underpantones makes the vivid rainbow of delightful tones available for the more ""private part"" of your wardrobe, but it's highly likely that you would want to show these off.

The UnderPantone creators, weigh in on their colorful creation:

""Overuse? Maybe. But, as they say, if you can’t beat ‘em… so, over a few beers, we decided to add to the products on offer. Ladies and gentlemen, for him and for her, we present underpantones (and, of course, pantytones)! If we had our way it’s what every well-dressed designer would be wearing.""

As a designer, I can now not only show my love for Pantone on the outside, but on the inside as well! They look cottony comfortable and the colors are obviously great. I hope these are available for retail soon, because I already have my own list of favorite Pantone colors ready to order!

Ever wake up to your alarm feeling like you haven't slept at all? Experts say that adults should receive 7-8+ hours of sleep per night. With my busy schedule I don't always receive the recommended amount. Routines, lifestyle and age are predicted to affect our sleeping patterns. I'm a bit of a nerd and have always been intrigued with sleep and dreaming. Imagine my surprise when I ran across an inexpensive sleep tracking device while reading one of my favorite blogs.

The entire blog post that day was about the Sleep Cycle App. It tracks what state of sleep you're in, average time spent asleep, how long you were in bed, etc. After using the app for 5 nights it will calibrate your sleep and rate it. It also allows you to enter sleep notes such as: Ate Late, Stressful Day, Worked Out, Drank Coffee. You can even make your own sleep notes! I can't be sure how accurate the information is but it's definitely interesting to review each morning. I've been using the app for almost two weeks and have no complaints.

The app is very user-friendly. You simply put it on the corner of your bed face down each night and turn on the app. You don't have to attach anything to your body and the app is only $0.99. With the phone being close to my head I typically turn my phone on airplane mode. Forget about annoying alarm sounds. The app offers a myriad of ""soothing"" alarms that will wake you when you are in your lightest point of sleep. It also lets you choose a 30 minute time window to wake up.

I've posted some pictures below of the graphs it populates to give you an idea of everything it tracks. The dates are listed at the bottom of the graphs.

Would you ever buy this app? What are your thoughts on it?

Before CS6, if a designer needed to produce multiple sizes of an ad, they needed to:
<ol>
	<li>Create ad #1</li>
	<li>Save as a separate document (ad #2)</li>
	<li>Resize the document settings</li>
	<li>Rework the layout to coordinate with the new specs.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 2-5 until all the different ad sizes have been created.</li>
</ol>
Phew! That’s a lot of steps for one little re-size. Now, with InDesign’s Alternate Layout function, designers can create multiple versions of a layout, for either print or electronic devices, all within the same document.

The Alternate Layout function allows a user to create a separate horizontal or vertical layout within the same document. The designer can even view both layouts side by side to compare the designs. One of my favorite features of this function is the “linked content”. All copy content is linked to each layout within the document. So, if you were to change a word or paragraph within one layout, all the others will recognize and change, as well. This saves time by allowing one quick change instead of having to open up all the different ads and manually changing each one.

Another feature within the Alternate Layout is the Liquid Layout. This is great if a user is designing for something across multiple devices. The designer can create different rules to determine how objects and copy appear on a page when the page changes size or orientation (for instance, if you have an iPad and want to design for vertical and horizontal layouts).  There are four rules that can be set:
<ol>
	<li>Scale – all the content on the page will be scaled in proportion, as the page resizes.</li>
	<li>Re-center – all the content on the page is recentered and remains its original size.</li>
	<li>Guide-based – all the content on the page is replaced based on guides that have been set.</li>
	<li>Object-based - each object can have a relative or fixed behavior attached to it’s outline.</li>
</ol>
These new features in inDesign allow designers to not only save time in resizing print collateral, but to also design more effectively across different platforms.","Alternate/Liquid Layouts in InDesign","2013-05-08 08:41:23"

A project comes in…

We gain insight on the project and its goals/objectives...

We draft and present a proposal…

Our proposal is approved…

What’s next?...

We schedule a kick-off meeting with all necessary departments/disciplines involved. As an Account Coordinator, one of my responsibilities is to make sure everyone is on the same page in order to keep the momentum of the job moving. Being an agency that has virtually eliminated the need for out-sourcing, it’s rather easy to call upon the needed minds to bring to the round table. Also, having each department playing for the same team, it is easy to prioritize each individual’s schedule and task list to meet the needs of the agency’s goals and deadlines.

Meeting Started.

I brief the team and bring them up to speed as to where we are with the particular project. This is where the fun begins. The industrious and creative perspectives from each department lend a hand in shaping our comprehensive course of action. Being under the same roof and interacting with our team on a daily basis plays an essential role in this process. We know each other well and have a strong understanding on how we can bounce ideas off each other in a productive manner to mold a good idea into an exciting and effective actionable plan. Thoughts are presented in an informal and humble manner with honest feedback among the group to develop and grow an idea. We know we can be honest with each other, whether the critique is favorable or not, to construct a strong framework to build on an idea or direction. This forthright and candid approach is welcomed, as we know it’s for the benefit of our client, and our relationships are strengthened because of it. I know I can throw out an idea and allow the rest of the team to fine-tune it…and vice versa.

We can depend on each other to help take a rough idea to a polished campaign, and we have the confidence in the people next to us that they can and will deliver innovative ideas. Being a product of team sports my whole life, it’s this team effort in taking on new challenges everyday that I enjoy so much.

We are all used to seeing the Weight Watchers ads on TV. You seem to get bombarded with them right after January 1<sup>st</sup>. I'm guessing that they want to take advantage of those of us that can’t button our pants after all of our holiday gluttony!

This year they started a new viral campaign on YouTube that they are calling their “I’m Only Human and I Did It Project.” This is a part of their bigger “Expect Amazing” campaign that they launched this year.

The viral campaign is meant to prove the idea that you don’t have to be perfect on the Weight Watchers plan to lose weight, and that you can still enjoy life and eat the foods you love.  It includes videos of real people speaking candidly about their struggles to lose weight but that through all of their struggles and lack of perfection they’ve managed to reach their goals just by sticking with the plan.

In addition to the official paid spokesperson videos, the public is also invited to upload their own videos.  If you’d like to check out the campaign yourself, you can find it <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/onlyhuman?x=us-en_showcase_106_7"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.","Weight Watchers Crowd Sources Ads with Real Success Stories","2013-05-13 07:32:18"

March Madness might be my favorite time of the year. I love watching the small schools upset the traditional favorites by imposing their own personality and style of play. So, like many others, I’m tuned in for the full three weeks of the tournament.

This means I get to see a lot of great basketball. It also means that I’m forced to endure those one or two spots that seem to run during each and every commercial break.

Who can forget the mind-numbing “Na-Na-NAPA know-how” song from a few years back, or the pompous double-daters spouting off, “Hey, man, that’s Spandau Ballet,” during last years tournament? Unfortunately, no one can.

To me, this year’s choice for most annoying commercial went to Southwest Airlines. But it’s not because I was forced to watch it so frequently. Actually, the spot was incredible tolerable in spite of its repetition. It was beautifully shot, featured an inspiring message and even included a catchy, popular song.

And it’s not because the technique has become familiar. To be honest, the first time I watched the spot, I was reminded of the well-produced KentuckyOne Health campaign that has been running for the past year or so. Or the Australian tourism ad that received acclaim a few years before that.

The Southwest spot bothered me so much because it completely deviated from the brand they had spent so much time and money cultivating. And, if you believe the voiceover in their new spot, it’s a brand that has been highly successful: <i>“America’s largest domestic airline.” </i>Just a few years ago, they were stuck firmly behind Delta Air Lines in that category.

So why the change?

Southwest’s appeal was that it never took itself too seriously. They had personality in an industry that had become cold, corporate and completely focused on the bottom line. Baggage handlers became heroes. Flight attendants showed irreverence. And passengers – even though they were fully aware they would be receiving budget service – bought in whole-heartedly.

Now Southwest comes across as slick, generic and filled with fluff. Even the new tagline, <i>Welcome aboard</i>, lacks any playful appeal.

Like I said, the new spot is nice. But it would be nice for any airline – or any service provider, for that matter – that has the money to spend and a hollow message to spread.

It’s just not the Southwest brand that I’ve admired. Worse yet, it feels like the once exciting underdog who knocked off the airline’s top seeds has abandoned the style of play that got them to the big dance.","Southwest Needs a Timeout","2013-05-10 15:01:24"

At Current360 we know that maintaining an active, staff-authored blog has a lot of benefits: it enhances our search engine visibility, showcases the many brilliant minds who work here and occasionally garners some attention from the <a href=""http://www.mediabistro.com/agencyspy/does-louisville-merit-an-nba-team-local-ad-agency-thinks-so_b43637"">outside world</a>.

But as many Bulbs will confess, crafting the mandatory monthly blog can be a horribly gut-wrenching, nausea-inducing experience, striking fear, unease and shame into even the most eloquent among us.

With that, I’d like to offer up some of my favorite techniques for dealing with blog anxiety.

<strong>5. Go to another room.</strong>

Ever walk into a room and forget why you’re there? ‘Turns out the brain ‘reboots’ itself when we walk through <a href=""http://7bigspoons.com/neurotechnology-tip/passing-door-scramble-brain/"">doorways</a>. Use this to your advantage. If you’re stuck in a rut, strut through a doorway to clear your mind and await the genius.

<strong>4. Read something good.</strong>

Mimicry leads to mastery, so if you’re struggling to get that first sentence out, take a few minutes to read some good writing. Think about the writer’s voice, pace and rhythm —then do your best impression.

<strong>3. Keep a blog-idea file open on your desktop.</strong>

Great blog topics come and go like the wind, so keep a doc ready for any brilliance that may descend from the ether. By the time the next blog’s due, you’ll have a nice little stash of thoughts to sift through.

<strong>2. Have a drink.</strong>

Nothing silences the inner critic like whiskey*. So if insecurities are making it hard to get your brain off the ground, maybe it’s time for a quick chat with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barleycorn"">John Barleycorn</a>?

<i>*Only for home-blogging.</i>

<strong>1. Don’t fear the reader.</strong>

It’s natural to be nervous about what others may think of your writing, but don’t get too concerned with outside opinions. Even Shakespeare had a few critics, and at the end of the day it’s just a blog, <i>not</i> the State of the Union Address. And if you’ve tried all of the above tricks and still can’t get the ball rolling, go talk it out with a friend. Chances are, they’re suffering from acute blog anxiety too.","5 Easy Ways to Conquer Page Fright","2013-05-14 09:16:06"

I have to admit, when I first heard that Louisville Slugger had revised their logo, I was disappointed. And a little dismayed.

I suppose this was partly due to the previous logo being so prevalent in my own memories of playing baseball, and partly because I strive every day to help my clients reach the level of worldwide recognition the Louisville Slugger logo had achieved. According to <i>Ad Age,</i> Louisville Slugger’s brand affinity scores outrank several heavyweights, including Harley Davidson and McDonald’s.

So, why make a change? After 129 years, the company would be undergoing just its second major logo revision – the first since 1980, when “Hillerich &amp; Bradsby” took a backseat to the Louisville Slugger name within the familiar oval.

After a little research, the motive for the redesign became clear. In short, Louisville Slugger is being undercut by new brands with new technologies that appeal to younger players and coaches. While current major leaguers still have an affinity for the history of the brand, these players would eventually be replaced by those who grew up with a wide range of options and, thus, very little sense of nostalgia for Louisville Slugger.

The brand had to modernize in order to survive. And, with the launch of a revolutionary new bat, the timing was right to move forward with a new mark.

But how far would they go to appeal to a younger demographic? How much of their current look would they sacrifice?

After seeing the new logo unveiled on MLB’s Opening Day, I was relieved. The new logo truly is the next step in the brand’s evolution. My biggest fear – a complete redesign that appears to come out of, ahem, left field – was not to be the case. The design is clean, modern and continues to utilize several iconic elements.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/imgres.jpeg""><img alt=""imgres"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/imgres.jpeg"" width=""273"" height=""152"" /></a>

For example, while the word Slugger is now noticeably larger than Louisville, the double g font remains to help bridge the old and new logos. And, thankfully, the Powerized mark – complete with lightning bolts – is still right where it’s always been.

All together, kudos to Louisville Slugger for finding a way to update their appearance without abandoning their legacy. They’ve created a mark that might keep players of all ages swinging that iconic oval design for years to come.","Louisville Slugger Swings for the Fences","2013-04-24 09:23:36"

Google Glass, an eye glass mounted, wearable computer was unveiled by Google’s X Lab roughly a year ago to a relative amount of interest and fanfare. It seemed that most were intrigued by the concept but laughed at the thought of actually wearing the sci-fi looking gadget on the side of their head. Many wondered if Google would move forward with their development or if they would be another forgotten Google experiment (see Google Wave). However, a few weeks back, a redesigned Glass appeared on the floor of the 2013 CES. Later, Google held an event and demoed the uber geek chic eyewear. Since then, Google has begun to field test them in a few target cities with a very select group of users.

For those of you who haven’t seen the footage, imagine a small transparent window in the upper corner of your field of vision. Through simple voice and or hand commands you can get directions, send text messages, even shoot stills and video. In theory, they could transform how we go about our daily lives and move the smart phone from our pockets to a live stream in front of our very eyes (or would that be eye?)

One group is working on face recognition software for the <a href=""http://www.33rdsquare.com/2012/07/google-facial-recognition-patent-filing.html"" target=""_blank"">tech specs</a>. Imagine walking down a crowded street and running into that guy you met a business function who’s name escapes you? No worries, his name and bio could pop-up on your display and you’re suddenly Dale Carnegie.

However, a pretty big backlash has begun. Recently, bar in Seattle posted signs <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/google-glasses-banned-seattle-bar-article-1.1284963"" target=""_blank"">banning the Glass</a>. The owner did admit it was a bit of a publicity stunt, but brought up a very valid point, he doesn’t allow people to take unwanted pictures of other patrons in the bar, describing it as a “private place that people go”, so he’s not going to allow people to do it on the sly via the Glass.  If someone came in wearing a pair, who’s to say they aren’t recording every customer? A site called <a href=""http://stopthecyborgs.org/"" target=""_blank"">StopTheCyborgs.org</a> launched, questioning if Glass can become an infringement to our daily privacy.  Could Glass become the first step down a path where our lives are recorded and monitored 24/7? Of course that’s assuming that people are going to shell out $1,500 for pair and be willing to record and post our  daily functions, like walking through the aisle of Home Depot... but the bigger question is where does it stop? And what happens to the data that is being fed from user? Suddenly every move, every purchasing decision, could be monitored, quantified and stored, or in Google’s case sold.

Personally I’m a bit intrigued by them, although I wonder if the screen would give you headaches or have a long term effect on your vision. Would they become  one more distraction in our lives?  I already feel tethered to my iPhone. From time-to-time, I’m guilty of having a  half attention span conversation  as I catch-up on my latest Twitter feeds. And don’t get me started about the panic inducing attack I have if I misplace my iPhone, or God forbid, walk out of the door without it.  I have no doubt some version wearable tech will become commonplace. It’s a natural evolution from where we are and the ever shrinking physical size of technology. I’m just not sure that Glass is that next step or one down the line.","What will become of Google Glass?","2013-04-25 05:36:08"

I came across a promotion that I thought was sort of cool. Or sort of ridiculous. Or perhaps just the intersection of a number of marketing and societal trends.

So many folks who have recently been married or are expecting (I'm both!) are, of course, likely aware of gift registries. Chrysler has taken this concept a step further and created an online gift registry in which consumers register for....a Dodge Dart.

Here's how it works: You sign up for the program, configure and customize a Dodge Dart (choosing colors, trim options, transmission, safety features, etc.), and set a goal for the amount of money needed to fund it. The program then itemizes parts of the car - seats, wheels, engine (even nuts and bolts!)  and allows friends, family - anyone really - to sponsor the parts. Check out the site <a href=""http://www.dodgedartregistry.com/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

You are then prompted to spread the word via Facebook and Twitter. There's even a means of thanking people who have bought items. This part is pretty smart - and I think where the rubber really meets the road as to the value of the promotion.

So while this seems perfectly suited for the Millennial generation - part kick-starter, a large pinch of social media, and a hearty reliance on the generosity of friends and family - I was pretty skeptical. Was this a publicity stunt or would anyone actually sign up?

As it turns out, there are currently 6,685 registries and over 1,200 parts funded. Not bad, but considering the marketing muscle behind it, perhaps disappointing. Some registries seem legitimate and compelling. Others, not so much. However, the number that ultimately counts is sales - and March set a monthly sales record with over 8,000 units sold.

Kudos to Dodge for thinking outside of the box and creating a smart - and well <i>targeted</i> - promotion for the Dart.","Dart Targets Millennials with Crowdsourced Social Media Mashup ","2013-04-29 08:39:29"

Perhaps it's an occupational hazard. Perhaps I'm too close to the industry. But I can't shake the feeling that now more than ever, the ""brief"" and – more specifically – the ""positioning statement"" are becoming a bit literal in today's consumer marketing products and executions.

Below are 4 words that I seem to see used a lot, as well as some of the trends that may be powering them. And, at least to me, they seem straight from a brief. In fact, I'll bet it's pretty rare to see any of these words apart from the context of a product or ad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Crafted. </strong>Blue Moon is ""Artfully Crafted."" Levis has a premium line of jeans called ""Made &amp; Crafted."" They'd probably pair well with Converse's line of premium leather ""Clean Crafted"" Chuck Taylors. Crafted speaks to the trend of consumers desiring authenticity, individuality and the ability to identify with a brand's soul. In the case of Blue Moon, the “artfully crafted” product is actually produced in mass quantities by corporate behemoth SAB MillerCoors, but it is carefully positioned as a micro-brew or craft beer. Is crafted then simply a shortcut used by big brand marketers seeking authenticity?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Curated. </strong>Another trend that marketers are exploiting is the fact that consumers want a customized or ""unique to them"" experience. The term curated is an interesting extension of this desire. We see digital content ""curated"" based on a consumers specific taste. We even see marketers ""curating"" advertorials in an effort to present branded content that is relevant to consumers. I receive e-mails from Brooks Brothers with selections that are ""carefully curated"" based on my browsing and purchase history. In the face of staggering selection, the online shopping trend is definitely towards curated selections. I just find it interesting to see such an obvious strategy utilized in such an overt manner.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Artisan. </strong>Wendy's offers an Artisan Egg Sandwich and has recently launched an Artisan sandwich platform to take on Panera. Sargento has an entire line of Artisan Blends cheeses. Tostitos has Artisan Recipes tortilla chips. Sam's Club ups the ante by combining two buzzwords for their Artisan Fresh line of bakery and deli products. (In fact, fresh could easily make this list.  It is a well-recognized consumer trigger in the food and restaurant world.) Much like “crafted,” consumers are looking for authenticity. And the artful marketers working with the corporate food industry are happy to serve it up!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Healthing. </strong>To be fair, this isn't even an actual word. But I’ll be darned if it doesn't look straight from the brief. Lysol has a new campaign in which they encourage consumers to ""Stop just cleaning, and start healthing."" With health and wellness as an overwhelming consumer need, Lysol has attempted to elevate themselves from the category by claiming to be the brand that delivers clean and healthy.</li>
</ul>
In conclusion, I don't necessarily believe pulling words or messages directly from the brief is a bad thing. I just find it interesting and think it speaks to a phenomenon of increasingly sophisticated marketers trying to “out strategize"" one another in their quest to “elevate the Brand” and connect with consumers.","Is your product healthing?","2013-05-17 07:38:25"

Beginning in July, Google will not display text ads that feature phone numbers.  It is said that listing a phone number, as seen below, can be confusing and misrepresent the intention of the user when clicking redirects to a URL, rather than dials the phone number.

If displaying your phone number is important, do not fear, Google has a solution for you.  By using the call extension option your ad will include a clickable call button on high-end mobile devices or will appear with a phone number listed beside your text ad on desktop computers and tablets.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AL-Blog-Image.jpg""><img alt=""AL Blog Image"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AL-Blog-Image.jpg"" width=""448"" height=""349"" /></a>

These enhanced campaigns will provide the benefits of measure phone call conversions and provide better extension reporting.  Pretty exciting!

I applaud the lead-time that Google had provided to advertisers, as three months should allow enough time to make the necessary revisions.  I think that the mobile version makes a ton of sense.  When using a mobile device, it’s very convenient to click a call button, rather than searching for a phone number.  I’m curious however, as to what others think about the desktop version.  I, for one, mostly use a desktop computer in the vicinity of a phone, so viewing a phone number within a paid text ad, allows me to call the number directly from my phone and actually saves the advertiser the cost for my click to go to their website.  What do you guys think?","Call Me, Maybe?","2013-06-14 12:35:43"

Target recently built a 1,600 square foot ""doll house"" in the middle of Grand Central Station. That's about 500 square feet bigger than my 1st house!  It was installed to promote Target's Threshold line. They placed between 3,500 to 4,500 pieces from the line within the structure and placed more interactive moments throughout, including a makeover station in the bathroom. About 2 dozen items included QR codes enabling you to purchase right from your smart phone. The 2 story house had an open floor plan and encouraged people to touch and play with the items. They asked social media users to use #thedollhouse when posting about their experience. I became aware of the campaign from a home fashion blogger that I follow on Instagram and immediately had to investigate.

The Threshold line launched back in the Fall, and I'm already a huge fan. It rivals pieces seen at such places as Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma Home or Anthropoligie, but at much attainable prices.  I would have loved to have been there to check this out first hand!

Blogs. There have been a lot of buzz about them the past few years. In college I had to create and update a blog for used WordPress. I'm an avid fashion follower, and constantly consuming information on new products, designers and inspiration via fashion blogs.

The world of advertising is an ever-evoloving and long gone are the days where we can only advertise via one vehicle. I believe that blogs may have found their place in the advertising world--at least in fashion. Many designers will send out samples and gifts to bloggers who have a large following in hopes of sparking interests with consumers. Blogs are one of the main ways I find out about new products and often times it will lead me to purchase something...or at least add and remove it from my ""shopping bag"" 5 times. (I've been to known to get a bad case of buyer's remorse.)

Blogs can be great advertising and product placement, especially for up and coming designers or small boutiques. For example, I heard about GiGi New York who produces cute handbags and clutches about a year ago. I was walking through Von Maur the other day and lo and behold there was an entire display of GiGi New York items! They're definitely beginning to make a splash and I've even spotted a few of my friends carrying them. Many bloggers will write reviews about certain products they receive, and I find them highly credible. They're typically my age and have the same function for the products as me. I like to think of it as a great networking tool between fellow fashionistas.

It is estimated that there are over 6.7 million people publishing blogs on blogging sites and 12 million using their social networks. Women make up the majority of the blogging world and are between the ages of 18 and 34. This makes sense because there are a ton of ""mommy blogs"" and fashion blogs. The growth of this segment will only increase with time.

Blogs can be a great way to speak to an attentive audience. Think of them like a Birchbox. They're a company that sends you a boxful of sample beauty products each month. The consumer signs up for a monthly subscription and voila! Beauty fanatics line up for subscriptions and it's great for retailers because they are advertising to their target market. See my blog <a href=""http://current360.com/play/capturing-the-mom-in-her-native-online-environment/"">here</a> where I mentioned them. Most consumers in today's world like to read numerous reviews before making a purchase and blogs can be an outlet for reviews on products you're actively looking to buy.

At Current 360, we've utilized bloggers for a PR stunt. It was for our client AirStone, an alternative choice for natural stone. We targeted the DIY market and sent a kit that included a few samples of the product and a gift card to purchase AirStone to try on a project at home. The only catch? They had to submit photos of their finished project. We had an overwhelming success with the project and the client was pleased that we had created a few new brand evangelists.

JCPenney has attempted to bounce back from the damaging strategies it took on during ex-CEO Ron Johnson's reign. But first, they want to say they're sorry. In JCPenney's recent apology ad, they begged customers to ""come back"" to their stores. In this admirably honest, new commercial, which is a first glimpse from JCPenney's new lead creative agency, Young &amp; Rubicam in New York, the brand admits that their troubles are ""no secret,"" but that they are committed to winning us back.

In the commercial the voiceover says: ""It's no secret. Recently, JCPenney changed. Some changes you liked, and some you didn't. But what matters with mistakes is what we learn. We learned a very simple thing: to listen to you. To hear what you need to make your life more beautiful. Come back to JCPenney. We heard you. Now, we'd love to see you."" The spot ends with the full JCPenney name, and the lines ""Come back to see us"" and ""We're listening on Facebook."" Watch the video:

<iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nkNNyBT5uEs"" height=""240"" width=""400"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0""></iframe>

More of a primary concern for me is their new logo, with branding surveys showing JCP logo awareness dropped as much as 28 percentage points from 2010 and 2012. The new commercial also featured a redesigned logo, one that uses the company's full name rather than the hip ""jcp"" design taken on last year. In my opinion, to continue to make changes to the logo hurts the consumer awareness of the brand more and more.

And if it wasn't bad enough already, a recent JC Penney billboard posted in California, featuring a tea kettle, sparked a flood of complaints on social media for closely resembling Adolf Hitler. (shown below) JCPenney responded to the controversy with a tongue in cheek response, ""Certainly unintended. If we'd designed the kettle to look like something, we would've gone w/a snowman."" Despite mass complaints about the Nazi dictator resemblance, the kettle completely sold out at JCPenney stores.

In addition to a new logo and apologetic commercial, JCPenney also unveiled a social media effort to ask customers' suggestions and respond to virtually anyone that tweeted using #JCPListens, taking the hashtag quite seriously. They even brought back a brand they had stopped carrying in the store, because consumers said they missed it on Facebook.

It's pretty obvious that JCPenney is looking for a major upheaval of its brand, and it seems like these new strategies might be promising.

Let's say you have a really great brand, a super-loyal fan base and a desire to make yourself look really dumb. Here are three quick and easy steps to tarnish your brand and boost your sales:

1. Lament over how victims of history never had the chance to meet you. Take a page from Justin Bieber, who recently visited the Anne Frank Museum in Amsterdam and wrote in the guest book, ""Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.""

Not only did he get his name in countless blogs and news outlets, he also had a rabbi and Anne Frank expert, get his back, saying ""She was very modern and she could very likely be his fan and on Twitter."" Now, one could argue that Anne Frank would've been more into that nice masculine Jewish boy Adam Levine, but score one for the Bieb for successfully exploiting an international symbol of persecution for his own ends.

2. Try to keep your brand top of mind during a natural disaster. Take for example the Gap, who tweeted in the lead up to Hurricane Sandy, one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory to hit the Northeast, ""All impacted by #Sandy, stay safe! We'll be doing lots of <a href=""http://Gap.com/"">Gap.com</a> shopping today. How about you? <a href=""http://4sq.com/QPVDT9"">4sq.com/QPVDT9</a>"" Gap apparently apologized for the tweet later, but should have only if they weren't having a hurricane relief khaki sale.

This is a perfect example of the maxim ""There's no such thing as bad publicity.""

3. Inject your personal politics into your brand. The nation is as politically polarized as it has ever been, so why not take advantage? If you're currently attracting only 30% of the buying public, alienating 1/2 of the population in order to garner loyalty from the other half makes a lot of sense. Witness Papa John's assertion that, because of Obamacare, he was going to have to raise the price of his pizzas by $0.14 and cut his employee's hours to avoid as many full time employees as possible. Add to this that Papa John Schnatter lives in a starter castle and gives away millions of free pizzas every year, and he instantly became reviled by half of the country and a hero to the other half. And he wisely chose to align his company with the half with the money.

Now, purchasing slightly sweet pizza is a political statement. That'll show 'em!

The take-away from all this is that you don't have to be ""ethical"" or ""sensitive"" or even ""nice"" to be successful. Of course, those things help while building your brand, they are not necessary once you are established. Really all you need is a burning desire to succeed and an indifference to your public persona.

"Rob","<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AdAgeDigitalConference.jpg""><img alt=""AdAgeDigitalConference"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AdAgeDigitalConference.jpg"" width=""602"" height=""375"" /></a>

On April 16th, AdAge kicked off its annual Digital Conference, self promoted as the Most Important Event of the Year for Marketers, wherein awards for the best viral videos with branded content were handed out. Among the videos honored were the Red Bull Stratos campaign, following Felix Baumgartner's record breaking freefall, TNT's ""Your Daily Dose of Drama"" and P&amp;G's ""Proud Sponsor of Moms."" Some of these you've probably seen, but some of them left me (at least) saying ""Whaaa?""

Liquid Plumr's ""Double Impact"" was the funniest viral video last year? Seriously? Nothing funnier than that?

Of course AdAge is evaluating viral videos that are geared toward marketing brands, not all viral videos. If you compare the AdAge list with Youtube's top 10 of 2012, you find the only overlaps are the TNT video (which I was one of the few, apparently, who never saw the original) and the Red Bull Stratos highlights video. The rest of the Youtube videos are music videos, the KONY doc and the dad from Albemarle NC whose feelings were so hurt by his daughter's lack of respect that he shot her laptop with hollowpoint bullets. One could make the argument that Psy is a brand at this point, and he had not only the most popular video from last year, but of all time - 1.5 billion views as of this writing. But since it was not part of a marketing campaign devised by an agency, it was not considered a branded viral video.

But what exactly does viral video mean? It has become such a ubiquitous marketing term that it is close to becoming meaningless. We are sometimes asked to produce viral videos, which is impossible to do, since it is something that can only be accomplished in hindsight. Viral video isn't euphemistic for a video that was shot with an iPhone. It doesn't mean a video that has cats in it or even one that is funny. A viral video is a video that is so popular that it spreads around the internet like a virus through social media outlets and email. Only the general public with access to the Internet can make a video viral.

But viral videos can incorporate those things. One thing that is apparent in watching all the top videos that went viral in 2012 from both lists is that a lot of thought went into the production of each video. The producers of each clearly spent a lot of time thinking of a way to make something remarkable, and were so successful that people felt compelled to share it with their friends and family. Even the laptop murderer, although in his case it was probably minutes of pre-production rather than days. Some were funny, some were shocking and some just amazing, but each one had something that made you feel like you'd never seen anything quite like it before. Or done as well.

Another thing that is apparent is that these are almost all big budgeted productions. Obviously, laptop dad and Spoken Reasons were low budget homemade jobs, and some may just look like they had big budgets, but the rest involved fairly significant resources to pull off the killer idea behind the production. The thing that kills most ideas is sticker shock. Most people don't realize the expense of video production is much higher than it appears on screen. It takes a lot of time, talent, planning, resources and sheer luck to make a great video.

So if you are inspired to make a video of such quality that it goes viral, here's what you need to do. Start with an original idea that won't draw comparisons to something we've seen before. Make it mean something. And be willing to do what it takes to make the idea work, undiluted.

Or better yet, call us and we'll do it with you.","What ARE the qualifications for a truly viral video, anyway?","2013-05-27 20:43:23"

Here in the Web Development land of Current 360, we create and implement web forms on behalf of our clients. So, we make sure the forms look neat and professional, but that's just one side to it. In fact there is a name for it. Front-end development. That's the part of the service that is facing the users.

Now, if there is a front-end one might suspect that there is also a corresponding posterior side and that that person would be correct. I'm sure you already figured out what it's called ... The backend is for processing the data received from the user in the front end.

Now, when the front end passes off the user data to the back-end is it safe to assume that the information being passed is harmless? No way buster! The data that gets passed will most likely either be used to figure something out for the user or be housed in a database, or any number of other tasks that websites can do.

Anyway I took a long route to get to my point but here it is, That user inputed data has to be sanitized or filtered before it gets worked on, and definitely before it gets put onto a database table. If not properly sanitized this data could potentially compromise the security of your sites server and the data housed in your database.

PHP offers built in filter functions for sanitizing data. That combined with prepared sql statements can help put your mind at ease that you've done what is needed to protect the integrity of your database.

Rule of thumb: All data you get from a user is dangerous and will harm your database.","Sanitizing Data is a Critical Step","2013-05-29 15:20:59"

I just received a curious email from my brother-in-law, inviting me into the inner circle of something called Rippln. I remember when GMail first launched, it was by invitation only at first, as was Spotify, so I was immediately intrigued. Especially when I read the boilerplate language of the invite:

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image.png""><img alt=""image"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image.png"" width=""730"" height=""320"" /></a>

Working behind the scenes? NDA? Viral app? What the hell?!

So, before I signed any NDA, I decided to see what Google had to say. Searching for Rippln, I found a bunch of links to press releases, some thinly veiled as reviews or news stories, all of which stress the moneymaking opportunity involved in Rippln, none of which saying what the app actually is, other than a way for people to communicate with each other and purchase third party apps. If only my phone had a device that enabled me to communicate to others directly and allowed me to purchase apps! That would be truly revolutionary.

On top of that, through Rippln, you can make money off your social network. Although everything is very hush hush and the app itself is still not available, it's possible to get in on the ground floor. In fact, in the video they compare the impending explosion of this app to Facebook and email! Except, Facebook and email actually do something. But still, you can get in on the ground floor!

After some investigation, I found the blog of a guy who may or may not have signed the NDA, but who is sharing the <a href=""http://joelcomm.com/rippln-mobile-app-and-network-marketing.html"" target=""_blank"">animated videos anyway</a>. It turns out that Rippln's biggest innovation may be bringing the pyramid scheme to mobile marketing. You get paid by promoting Rippln, getting people to sign up to Rippln, who then sign up others and you get paid again and so on and so on. It's a steady stream of income depending on how many are on your team. So, getting in early is key. What they don't tell you is how much it costs to become a ""player"". So you make money off of your social network by promoting Rippln on existing social platforms that actually allow you to interact and build a network. Rippln looks to be only a tool to allow you to see how many underlings you have and how much cash is flowing into your pockets. It appears to be a social app in the same way that chlamydia is a social disease. Not so social.

Anyway, I'm passing on this opportunity, as tempting as the lure of easy money is. Rippln has all the earmarks of aI will say that the videos are well done.","Get Ready to Ripple with Rippln!","2013-06-04 05:08:23"

I recently began a quest to lower my television and internet bills.  I called my current provider to see what kind of deals they’d cut me, and unless I wanted to bundle with a landline, my cost-saving mission was not going to be successful.

It got me thinking about how often I see advertisements for home phone lines though.  And it kind of started to irritate me thinking the only way I could bring down my rates would be by giving them more money for a service I don’t need – a service many people don’t need.  I mean, does anyone have a landline anymore?  I could count on one hand the people I know with one.  Everyone has a cell phone nowadays, and most people I know use it for their “home phone.”

So why do they push so hard?  Every other day I get a postcard in the mail advertising for home phones.  Every time I call AT&amp;T or Insight I have to listen to an on-hold message about how I need one.  Seems to me if they stopped spending advertising dollars on an obsolete service, and offered savings on the services I already have, I’d be a much happier customer.","Customer Service would Buy AT&T a lot more than Direct Mail","2013-06-03 07:56:01"

When I first started at Current Marketing, we used to have something called ""Drinks on the Veranda."" It was an informal thing at first. Clients and vendors would stop by after work on Friday to have a cold beverage, trade stories from the previous week and just generally enjoy each other's company. Some of my fondest memories of Current revolve around those afternoons on the porch, laughing with my friends and getting to know the clients and vendors that made it possible for us all to make a living while having fun.

Before long, it went from a few people to a small army and folks were dropping by earlier and staying later, so we eventually made it a little more formal and turned it into a less frequent, but more elaborate gathering. We went from a few beers in the fridge to a bar set-up and music. And one of my first assignments at CM was to put together music for one of the parties.

So I burned a few CDs and even made a few to give away at the big event. And the one that really went over well, at least with the people at CM, was a mix of songs that all had employee names in them. (I was into themed playlists, even back then.)

We're quite a bit bigger now, and a lot of the names have changed, but I thought it might make for a fun blog to put together a music playlist with all of today's employee names. It was a taller order than I expected and I had to take some liberties with spelling, but here are some things I learned while putting together this list:
<ol>
	<li>I don't have as much music as I thought I did.</li>
	<li>People don't write songs about men. (Some of these selections are a stretch, but when was the last time you were singing along to a song about somebody named Chaney on the radio? Exactly.)</li>
	<li>Nobody has ever written a song about anyone named KaiLee. So if there are any aspiring songwriters out there...</li>

As you’ve likely heard, Paula Deen, America’s most famous butter slinger, has found herself in hot water after admitting during a court deposition to using racial slurs in her past.

While I’m not sure why (or if) anyone is actually surprised that a 66-year-old Georgia Peach has used such language in her life, I do find it interesting how quickly the outrage caused by her admission has burned out of control, leading to a media-dominating controversy that has so far cost her an 11-year-position with Food Network and jeopardized millions of dollars in endorsement deals with the likes of K-mart, Sears and others.

To be clear, I’m not trying to minimize the seriousness of Deen’s words: there’s no excuse for using racial slurs. However, even though I understand the sensitivities involved, I think it’s interesting to ponder how — from a marketing perspective — Paula Deen can save her brand. So Paula, here’s my advice. Do with it as you please:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Go off the radar for a while.</strong>
Deen has now released three poorly produced, hastily thrown-together <a href=""http://eater.com/archives/2013/06/21/paula-deen-responds-to-racist-testimony-in-video-statement.php"">YouTube apology videos</a> — each stranger and more uncomfortable to watch than the last. The videos portray a solo, groveling Deen making vague mea culpas to her friends, fans and those whom she offended.The problem with the videos is that not one of them approach anything close to sincerity. In fact, the poor production values make them seem downright unserious. Worst of all, they have only added more kindling to a media firestorm that is already raging white-hot. So pull it back, Paula. Lay low for a while.</li>
	<li><strong><strong>Issue an HONEST written statement.</strong></strong>This should’ve been the first step. Written statements don’t make for compelling television; they don’t provide the red meat that videos and press conferences do — but that’s the point. A boring-but-honest written statement — one in which Deen allows herself to be honest and vulnerable — can help minimize any further damage until Lindsay Lohan’s next arrest recaptures America’s attention.In this statement, Deen needs to break character and drop the “lawdy me” southern belle act. She needs to admit that, while there are no excuses for her actions, hurtful language and harmful attitudes about race were ingrained in the culture in which she was born. Again, it’s not an excuse or a justification — just a substantial truth that will sooner resonate with her audience than a hollow apology.</li>
	<li><strong>Do an AMA with Reddit.</strong>Odd as it sounds, Deen’s racist revelation could’ve been much, much worse. She wasn’t caught in the act like Michael Richards or Mel Gibson. In fact, one could argue that her trouble stemmed from being honest. For this reason, I believe she’s in a better position to earn redemption than some others who’ve shared this position.
However, instead of taking the predictable path and groveling at the feet of Oprah or Barbara Walters, I believe Deen would better benefit from the inelegant, non-sensational platform of <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA"">Reddit’s AMA</a>.The popular Q&amp;A forum, which has played host to everyone from Dutch sex workers to President Obama, would give Deen an opportunity be honest and contrite without risking verbal gaffes or poor “optics” (an expression I hate, by the way).</li>
</ol>
So what do you think Paula Deen should do? Can she survive this controversy and save her brand? Or is it too late to butter up her fans again?","How Paula Deen Can Save Her Brand. ","2013-06-28 09:55:49"

In the media lately, there has been much debate over what internships should be. On my second day as an intern at Current360 news of lawsuits, filed on behalf of interns at Fox Searchlight Pictures aired and was the subject of debate for weeks to come. Naturally this news caught my attention as a newly planted intern, but I quickly discovered this was not going to be the stereotypical coffee / lunch / fourth meal/ ordering position. There was work of my own to be done, and not the kind that requires brooms or dust pans (at least not yet).

I was given an assignment of piecing together an instructional video for WaterStep, a client that specializes in clean water outreach. If you’re not familiar with their organization, you should be. Amongst other things, they send water purification systems to areas of the world that are in dire need of clean water.  So wait, you’re telling me I get a project of my own? With a clean canvas and almost unlimited amount of creative freedom? And it’s for a great cause?  Yep.

This was exactly the type of experience I was looking for. I wanted to get entangled into the system, to gain an understanding of how this whole business works. I wanted to sit in production meetings and see for myself how a project goes from concept to camera to television.  Such inner-workings of the collaborative process are what I needed to experience for myself, and in my opinion that’s what an internship should really be about. In a months time I have attained practical knowledge and experienced some of the more subtle nuances of advertising that frankly, a

So comparing my experience with that of the aforementioned plaintiff's and friends of my own, I recognize how incredibly lucky I have been to get such an opportunity.  However stifling the situation might be, education is and always will be what you make of it.

So if your finishing up your college career and weighing the opportunity costs of that epic summer (which you will most likely forget) vs. an internship that could pay dividends in the long run... go with the latter.","Internships: The right way","2013-07-15 08:03:03"

For those who struggle to continuously improve their rankings in online search results, search engine giants such as Google and Bing may appear to be manipulative ogres whose sole mission is to constantly confuse and baffle the common man with relentless algorithm updates – as many as 600 a year.

Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, their goal is the same as any business owner, to provide a satisfying experience in order to foster brand loyalty and ensure customer retention. They know that if the search results they provide leave you unsatisfied, you’ll search elsewhere.

To help you better understand the science of search, here’s an overly simplified example of how search works. Search engines employ software called “spiders” to continuously crawl the internet, indexing and re-indexing web pages…billions of pages. So when someone searches for Hugh Jackman, the search engines pull any page that references “Hugh” or “Jackman.”

Knowing that you don’t want to sort through pages devoted to Hugh Hefner, Hugh Laurie, Jackman Fabrics or Hugh, Maine, the search engines rank pages, placing the ones most relevant to your search closest to the top. Below are only a few examples of the hundreds of factors that affect search results.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Keyword proximity. </strong>If a page mentions “Hugh Jackman” rather than “Hugh Laurie recommends Jackman Fabrics,” the first site is placed higher than the latter.</li>
	<li><strong>Keyword density.</strong> A page that mentions Hugh Jackman in the headline and then several times in the copy, will rank higher than a site that only mentions his name in the cast credits.</li>
	<li><strong>Freshness of content. </strong>If a website’s latest Hugh Jackman entry reviews his 1999 depiction of Curly in the made for TV “Oklahoma,” it won’t rank as high as a website covering his latest turn as Wolverine.</li>
	<li><strong>Links to site. </strong>Websites that other websites link to for information on Hugh Jackman, such as Entertainment Weekly or TMZ, will rank infinitely higher than the Worldwide Wolverine Whitepaper, a blog written by a 47 year old D&amp;D dungeon master from his parent’s basement.</li>
	<li><strong>Age of site. </strong>The older your site, the more reliable the search engines will perceive it to be.</li>
	<li><strong>Site traffic.</strong> The more web traffic you have, the more popular your website will be perceived.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media Shares. </strong>If a website’s content it being liked, shared, retweeted and +1, search engines will consider your content to be fresh, relevant and engaging.</li>
</ul>
So the next time you conduct a search query, take a moment to marvel at the quality of information that is returned to you in less than a second. Mind blowing isn’t it?  <i>FYI – About 17,500 “Mind Blowing” results were returned in .28 seconds.</i>","The Science of Search, Simplified.","2013-07-22 09:10:56"

You are using a Mac (if you aren’t, you should be) and you keep hearing all this great stuff about Ruby (the language, not the gemstone) so you have decided that you are going to learn how to program.

First of all, that’s awesome, way to go, I like you already.

So, being new to this whole Ruby thing, you go to the Google and type in <i>how to install Ruby on a Mac</i>. The very first article that pops up is <a href=""http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-install-ruby-on-a-mac/"" target=""_blank"">this one by Jeffery Way</a>. Which is awesome because Jeffery Way is great at writing tutorials.

Anyway you follow along with his tutorial and everything goes swimmingly.  You are feeling good. You’ve got Ruby installed and updated with the added bonus of Rails as well.

Now you are feeling like a programmer already so you decided to jump into your first Ruby program right way.  You have always wanted to have a personal blog about just how awesome your yo-yo skills are so you decide to write a blogging platform in Ruby. Having fired up the terminal you type in <i>rails new myYoyoBlog</i>.

The next thing you know stuff starts flying along the terminal screen with great speed and you are getting really excited now. You take a look at the files and you’ve got Models, Views, and Controllers. This thing is practically done.

You are a smart cookie (I mean, you are on a Mac and are learning Ruby after all) so you do a little Googling and find out that your blogging app is going to need a database.  After a little more Googling you decide that <b>postgres</b> is the way to go.

Finally that thing is installed and you are all ready to create your <b>database.</b>  So you jump back to the terminal and type <i>rake db:create</i>. Oh no! You’ve got errors flying all over the place saying the rake file doesn’t exist. How can this be? You’ve followed directions to a ‘t’ every step of the way.

You have two options: 1) decide programming just isn’t for you and pack it in or 2) open up your Xcode, go to the preferences, click on the Downloads Icon then click on Install. Once this has been downloaded and installed, restart Xcode and you will be good to go on your travels with Ruby.","All this great stuff about Ruby","2013-07-26 09:33:26"

A recent <a href=""http://adage.com/article/digital/video-ad-network-yume-homes-households/243007/"">article</a> on digital targeting on AdAge.com discussed the capabilities that YuMe, a video ad network, has developed to target individual households with custom ads.  The technology is at a premium, so the cost to do so is relative high for the few households that match the advertiser’s desired target, however there would be very little waste.  Currently the strategy is being piloted by Hyundai, which has the dollars to test such an innovative placement strategy.

YuMe has built upon this strategy by retargeting in-steam video ads for screens not associated with cable viewing.  At the moment, behavioral profiling is difficult on mobile devices because smart phones do not allow for the same cookie placement that desktop computers do.

I think the next logical next step is for a multi-screen technology company, such as AT&amp;T, which has mobile, cable and telephone properties to tie all of their data together across all platforms and target it’s users based on data they have already collected.

For example, I think eventually we will be able to target a household that subscribes to AT&amp;T U-verse and AT&amp;T as their mobile and landline telephone provider to have their behaviors profiled and also tied back to purchases made on the same credit card that is used to pay the above for the above services.  If this is possible, and doesn’t invade privacy laws, we could understand the demographics and behaviors of consumers on a household level and serve appropriate advertising messages to them on the same screens that have helped us collect the data.","The Next Frontier of Digital Targeting","2013-07-30 09:39:14"

It’s hard to believe that it’s been three years since Pinterest exploded onto the social media scene. While many have questioned the site’s place in marketing there is no denying that the social network has evolved into a space well-suited to achieve certain brand objectives.

Case in point: in 2010, our client RELAX Wines launched RELAXnation, an online community filled with lifestyle focused content for its active, female millennial consumers. A few months later, Pinterest emerged and quickly began picking up speed. After watching the network for a few months, we recognized this as an opportunity to reach and activate a larger, like-minded audience for the RELAX brand. As a result, sharing RELAXnation’s content on Pinterest and shifting the community to the emerging platform became a 2012 social media initiative.

<strong>Platform strategy and tactics, in a nut shell. </strong>

Since the launch RELAX Wines’ <a href=""http://pinterest.com/therelaxnation/"" target=""_blank"">Pinterest account</a>, our team has carefully curated and pinned content that aligns with the RELAX brand lifestyle. We’ve developed the account so it takes full advantage of Pinterest’s boards, dividing pins by topic so followers can engage with what is specifically of interest to them.

RELAX’s boards contain both usable and inspirational pins: recipes that pair well with the wines, entertaining and hosting tips plus lifestyle topics that fit our target demo. Consumer blog reviews, plus fan photos culled from Instagram, are also shared. Our content strategy follows an 80/20 rule, 80% of the content shared is from other sources, 20% from and of the brand. We hold a high quality standard for the shared content so we make sure every pin directs to a <a href=""http://www.winemarketingpros.com/pinterest-wine/pinterest-how-to/"" target=""_blank"">website</a> with information directly related to the pin and frequently adjust the layout of our boards to ensure that they are seasonally relevant. We also use Pinterest findings for content on RELAX’s other social platforms and test pins to see what type of content resonates with our core audience.

<strong>Grassroots research and analysis? Oh yeah!</strong>

In the spring of 2013 we ran a <a href=""http://pinterest.com/therelaxnation/sharethelove/"" target=""_blank"">#ShareTheLove</a> promotion to get insights into core consumer opinions on RELAX as well as a few other Schmitt Sohne wine brands.

To keep in check, we monitor using Pinterest’s analytics dash as well as other insight providers to measure the account’s success with the goals of increasing the online reach of the product (SEO, SOO), driving loyalty and affinity for the brand, and ultimately impacting sales.

<strong>Results? We got ‘em.</strong>

<strong></strong>After two and a half years of careful curation and platform development, we’re happy to report that this has resulted in an active community that is not only a hit with RELAX consumers and our client, but others in the <a href=""http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34042/The-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Pinterest-SEO.aspx"" target=""_blank"">social media</a> and <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/WDvS2OF4uT/"" target=""_blank"">advertising</a> industries.

I was recently deep into an internet blog topic search looking for a commercial from my teen years that starred Frank Hirata skateboarding on a mini-ramp, I think it was either a Frosted Flakes or Sunny D! commercial. Anyway, I stumbled upon a late 70’s ad campaign that MG Midget ran to try and revitalize interest in their sports cars using skateboarders to illustrate how responsive the car is.  This was a bit before my time as a skater began, but I was drawn it.  It did, after all, contain two of the things that interest me the most, skateboarding and advertising.  I read a little background info on the ads.  Turns out that in the mid to late 70’s, the Midget was experiencing a lull in sales and wanted to give the car a new younger, spry feel.  At the about the same time skateboarding popularity experience a peak in popularity.  So, what better than to show how young, fun and responsive your sports car is than to compare it to skateboards.  The commercial has color coordinated skaters and cars, cutting back and forth on a cone slalom coarse, through a park snake run and then surfing a spillway (Rick Howard’s spot, to all in the know!). Maybe the car's response wasn't exactly like a board on trucks, but it looked like a lot of fun driving up the embarkment.  I don’t think the youthful &amp; agile marketing campaign did the trick to reinvigorate the MG Midget sales in the long run, but it looked like a fun project.

Here’s a link to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifL8RGBKlNc"" target=""_blank"">MG MIdget commercial</a>, and here are a couple of the print ads.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG-ads.jpg""><img alt=""MG ads"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MG-ads.jpg"" width=""456"" height=""288"" /></a>

After seeing this commercial I thought of a few newer commercials that also use skateboarding to show the agility and responsive ability of the car:

The first is the new commercial for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruZArNGgZ1Q"" target=""_blank"">2013 Chevy line-up</a>.  During one section of the commercial it cuts to the Chevy Sonic and the car then starts to perform skateboard type tricks.  I think it even does a backside lipslide.

The second is a ford <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPgG5fj95eQ"" target=""_blank"">promotion for the Fiesta</a> driven by DC Shoes co-owner/co-founder Ken Block.  This one isn’t quite as much of a blatant comparison, but knowing Ken Blocks history with skateboarding and the fact San Francisco is one big skatepark, I’d say that skateboarding heavily influenced it.  Check it out.  It is awesome.","Skateboards Selling Sportscars","2013-08-02 08:54:39"

Within the past few weeks, my wife and I welcomed our first child, a beautiful baby boy. And like just about every new parent, we’re thrilled, enamored, tired and a bit scared and confused. And boy do the baby marketers know this. (In a clear case of Karma, my years spent marketing products to moms have come back to haunt me).  As we do our best to welcome and care for this precious little guy, the last 9 months have given me a unique perspective on the big business that is baby marketing.

With the recent proliferation of digital media, more than ever, today’s generation of parent’s have a wealth of parenting information at their fingertips. And with that a wealth of marketers looking to get their message to these impressionable – and even desperate - parents.

Marketers aren’t afraid to tap into parents insecurities, fears and feelings of inadequacy.  New parents are suddenly responsible for the health, safety and development of a tiny, helpless human being. And from this insight, was born a billion dollar industry.

Peruse any of the “must-have” checklists eagerly studied by first time parents and you’ll see what I mean. It makes me wonder how my generation survived beyond our first year? Clever marketers have taken each part of a parent and baby’s day and made it as safe, comfortable, cute – and expensive - as possible. Bathing, feeding, nursing, sleeping, dressing, transport, soothing – there are an explosion of products for each. We have stroller systems that have the all of the features of a sub-compact car – and a price to match. No wonder the average square footage of the average American home has more than doubled in the last 30 years – we needed somewhere to put all of this baby gear!

I’ve been ranting about this since we got our first piece of direct mail from baby marketers just hours after conception (how did they know before we did?).  But you know what? After 6 weeks of caring for our little guy, I’ll eat a little crow. At this point, any product that saves us a little time or soothes him when he’s fussy I’ll gratefully accept. Perhaps it’s like any modern convenience. So while I still roll my eyes at marketers playing the fear card, I’m thankful my child lives in a time with so many resources to help him grow up safe and happy.","Baby Marketing","2013-08-06 08:24:06"

When I think of interactive print materials….I get flashbacks to Scratch n' Sniff Stickers and Hypercolor clothing of my early 90’s youth. My have we come a long way in engaging consumers and creating a memorable user experience to either a brand or message being conveyed. In David Gianatasio's <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/musical-poster-interactive-paper-future-print-and-outdoor-ads-151477"" target=""_blank"">article</a> about Novalia’s 2-D interactive touch-screen drum kit poster, we see where traditional media and modern technology meet to raise the eyebrows of (what could be) <i>your</i> brand’s potential consumer.

This innovative advertising tool is already evolving into impressive Bluetooth applications with smartphones as Novalia’s Kate Stone states, “Packaging, greeting-card manufacturers, point-of-sale, bus-shelter advertising, books, newspapers—yes, you can touch a story in a newspaper and if you've got your smartphone with our app anywhere on your person it can automatically pick up the recording of the actual press conference.”

This old-meets-new media technology allows for companies and advertisers to run in any direction in applying interactive capabilities to their Brands. I, for one, am kind of nerding-out on this gadgetry implementation for media, and that is quite a statement given that I’m one of the least tech-savvy people around.

There is <i>one</i> thing that I think we all can agree this poster is lacking…(which Gianatasio's article references)…..I gotta have more cowbell!","Electronic Paper? Interactive Print Materials","2013-08-07 08:20:20"

Something interesting is happening in the Highlands. At the intersection of Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue, Louisville-based KFC — the second-largest fast food chain on the planet — is <a href=""http://www.qsrweb.com/article/215691/KFC-ready-to-open-a-fast-casual-spinoff"">launching a new restaurant concept</a> that flies the fast food coop for a more fast-casual, <i>upmarket</i> feel.

Calling to the secret blend of herbs and spices that anchor KFC lore, <i>KFC 11</i> will jettison the <a href=""http://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/blogs/lists/2011/01/28/Buckethead.jpg"">iconic buckets</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Down_%28sandwich%29"">arterial atrocities</a> for which it’s known, trading them for more sophisticated offerings like flatbreads, salads and “indulgent sweets.” And while the new concept will still serve up Colonel’s Sanders’ Original Recipe fried chicken, it will only be available sans bones — and sans Sanders.

As fast food old-timers like Wendy’s, Arby’s and McDonald’s strive to maintain relevancy among growing competition from newer brands like Chipotle, Panera and Qdoba, KFC’s move isn’t wholly unexpected. But for a brand so moored in finger-lickin’ down-home goodness, will a shift toward sophistication work? Will people buy it?

Granted, KFC 11 is (of now) a one-store test concept; it’s a safe, small-scale experiment, <i>not</i> a complete brand overhaul, so if it fails, little is lost. But if KFC 11 goes over well, it could become an invaluable real-world testing ground for all kinds of innovations like new menu items, pricing models and enhancements to the customer experience which could eventually trickle down to traditional KFC stores.

Without a doubt, I’m anxious to see how KFC 11 fares in a world that believes the brand is synonymous with greasy, calorie-loaded, health-free food. However, what I find most interesting about KFC 11 is that it will give KFC’s marketers a platform on which to push the limits of the KFC idea — to find out how far the brand will stretch.","Can KFC Change Its Feathers?","2013-08-08 09:11:22"

Growing up, I was aware of the Apple versus Microsoft wars that have been raging since the beginning of personal computing. There are many advantages to buying a Windows machine if you're a gamer and want to build your own nerd tower of if you're large company that needs to supply its workers with easy to repair/replace machines. I get it. I was a Windows user until college, when graphic arts school compelled me to purchase a Macbook Pro, for which I paid a hefty $2,500 (at least a student license of Creative Suite was included in that price). I've never been happier. There are some problems with OSX I sometimes have a conniption fit over and I sometimes miss the task bar and not having to sort through multiple open windows, but I'll probably never buy a non-Apple laptop just due to the superior track pad tech. As someone who also knows their way around the guts of a computer, Apple's trend towards throwing everything in a small space that requires the magical guidance of a “genius” at the “genius bar” drives me up a wall because of their service charges for basic things like installing RAM and swapping hard drives. It's an obvious scheme to give <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPX5mRSQ3pw&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPX5mRSQ3pw."" target=""_blank"">Scrooge McDuck</a> an even deeper golden coin pool to swim in and keep the average consumer in the dark (I'm a HUGE fan of teaching a man to fish when it comes to technology). Whatever...I'll just buy used Apple hardware for cheaper on the dollar.

That seemed more like an Apple slam, but remember that expensive Macbook Pro I bought in 2007? The thing is still running today (and it is running Lion!) after multiple falls onto hard surfaces and years of being my main computer. It got me through 5 years of college, including 3 years of heavy use in graphic design to a beer spill killing the k, I, 8 keys on the keyboard, but it's still my backup if I ever have problems with my iMac. It will never die, but she will be phased out of support. I don't care, that laptop and I have had great memories together and I'm rather way too attached to a piece of machinery to let it go. It's a stark contrast from my previous PC towers that started to go kablooey around age 3.

I've phased most Microsoft software out of my life in favor of open source applications like OpenOffice, but there is one plug-in I must absolutely use and loathe to use and that's Silverlight. Silverlight is used by Netflix to run their streaming videos and <i>I absolutely hate installing and using it</i>. Oh Silverlight, why do you crash almost every other day without any notice or care? Every crash reminds me of why I left the Windows world. It also reminds me of the piece of horribleness that is Internet Explorer 8 and below. What is it with you and your non-compliance? Why, as a company, did you, <i>the largest software company</i>, decide to buck following W3C standards and WebKit? Safari is fairly bloated as well, because it seems like Apple has trouble writing their own user apps without bloat (hello iTunes!), but at least it uses WebKit. But things seem to be turning around in the Microsoft world. It must have been their loss in the mobile department, since Android and iOS have been reigning, bickering kings for a while now. Time will tell, but I'm still going to hold tight to my overpriced hardware.","Apple versus Microsoft: The war rages on!","2013-08-09 09:36:51"

I recently came across the <a href=""http://adonit.net/"" target=""_blank"">Adonit site</a> a new stylus called the Adonit <a href=""http://adonit.net/jot/touch/"" target=""_blank"">Jot Touch 4</a> caught my eye.  I’ve been using a Wacom Bamboo tablet and stylus for a few years now and really like the way it functions, so I was curious how the Jot stylus differed.  As I ventured through the Adonit site and learned about the Jot Touch a few major differences jumped out quickly.

The first thing I learned was that the Jot stylus is used in conjunction with the iPad or iPad Mini.  You can download apps for drawing &amp; sketching, taking notes or adding edits to a pdf. It don’t think it works with android tablets yet, but I’m sure android apps will come along soon enough for all those folks who don’t have an iPad but still enjoy the fell of the stylus.

Second thing I noticed was how the tip on the stylus is designed.  The Jot stylus has a very fine and sharp tip rather than a rounded bulky tip like the Wacom stylus.  The fine tip has a more precise pressure sensitivity which allows for stroke weight to vary to a greater degree than most other stylus’s with the bulkier tip. The Jot stylus also has a small plastic (or some sort of polymer similar to plastic) connected to the end of the fine tip. This small transparent disc allows you to view exactly were the line will be drawn.  I also assume that the disc is preventative also.  Keeping the sharp tip from damaging the surface of your iPad.

Another nice feature is that you can rest you hand on the iPad while you sketch and only the pressure from the Jot stylus will be recognized.  As someone who likes to sketch this is important because I don’t have to float my hand above the device.  Being able to rest my hand on the iPad would allow for a more natural feel to sketching.

I haven’t had a chance to use the stylus yet, but after watching a few of the videos provided on the Adonit site that highlighted these features, I really want to try the Jot Touch 4 Stylus.  The expert control this stylus provides with line weights and quick color options have lead me to believe the Jot Touch is far superior to my good ol’ bamboo tablet.

I love to just grab a sketchbook and pencil and find a nice quite place to draw and I think this is a great solution for creating that same experience digitally while retaining a natural look and feel to sketching.","Tools of the Trade: Adonit Jot Touch 4","2013-08-12 08:24:36"

And useless. The Beer Player.

The folks at Beck's Beer and Gyro Constructivists have come up with a process by which they can record sound onto the surface of a beer bottle, much in the same way Edison originally recorded sound onto wax cylinders more than a century ago. While it was obviously a challenge to get a high fidelity sound from the surface of a bottle, they managed to get a fairly high quality recording of the latest single from Auckland pop band Ghost Wave, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNVNNZN4ycQ"" target=""_blank"">Here She Comes</a>."" Check out the story of creating the Edison Bottle <a href=""http://vimeo.com/68007497"">here</a>.

Being that I a recently rediscovered the joys of vinyl recordings (with a growing collection of LPs to prove it) and I'm a long-time fan of beer (with a collection of embarrassing stories to match), this project is right in my wheelhouse. And while I can't completely get past the publicity stunt nature of this project, (there's one recording and one player, with no plans to do more) the cool factor of the whole thing has managed to quell my cynical nature. They spent a ton of time and money to do something cool, but ultimately useless. Except that it got me to listen and to think about Beck's for the first time in a very long while.

As the old song goes, “Everything Old is New Again,” even in this digital age.* With that in mind, I have discovered, while perusing the internet of course, that tintype photography is making a comeback, albeit a niche one.

To the uninitiated, tintype photos were invented in 1851 by Frederick Scott Archer and came into popularity during the Civil War, because they could be made quicker, easier and less expensively than a daguerrotype.  A tintype image is made directly to a metal plate placed in the camera. The plates are individually prepared and must be exposed and developed within minutes or they are ruined.

While researching the comeback, I found Staff Sargent Ed Drew, a soldier who served in Afghanistan. He is also a student at San Francisco Art Institute and he decided to take tintype photos during his last tour of duty.  He specifically took the tintype photos to preserve, for eternity practically, this period of his life for his newborn son. And for future generations, because tintypes can last for many years. Plus, he used the tintype photos for a photos can be found <a href=""http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/08/08/veteran-tintype-photographs"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

There is also a Photobooth tintype studio in San Francisco.They will create your tintype photo while you wait, using the same process originally developed in 1851.

But the real connection of old and new has been created by an online company that wants you to upload your digital photos and they will reproduce the photos using authentic tintype materials and process. They will reproduce pictures, of course, but they can also turn your photos into necklaces and cufflinks. This allows you to take your children, pet, or whatever you cherish with you wherever you go, yet sporting it with an antique feel.

I have tintype photos that were passed from my grandfather to me, through many generations. Perhaps I should go on Antiques Roadshow and discuss the material worth of my family treasure!

I’m a creative person. We all are in different ways. Around this time last year I was perusing the web in search of videos to spark some sort of creative juices, and after almost an hour I realized that I had nothing to show for it. Was I better in anyway for watching 60 minutes worth of videos on Vimeo just to stay up with the trends? Personally, I do not think so. Aren’t good ideas supposed to be changing, going against the grain? Perusing the web for an hour just left me assessing my own portfolio with nothing to show for it. Everyone’s process is going to be different and by looking at the countless books on honing creativity, it seems that the ways most people work varies.

I decided I was going to try to organize my time, so I needed to develop a real process. Before embarking on personal work, I was going to allot myself twenty minutes of web surfing. The content had to be quality.  Reading something that was interesting, but not surfing the latest camera reviews or shopping for gear I know I will probably never buy. After that twenty minutes was up, I was to write or draw out any ideas that came to mind.  At least then, would I have something to show for my time.

So, I bought a few un-lined notebooks and tried to diligently stick to my plan. Of course its harder to stick with when projects are exciting to work on, but for myself realizing that ideas come easier and more freely then, rather than in a slump.  I’m sure my process will evolve more over time, but so far I have built a hands-on library of ideas for inspiration when in a slump. Many times I don’t have a full hour to do this.  So, I try to keep my notebook with me, jotting down ideas or drawings as they come to mind.  The key to all of this of course, is to revisit the notebooks often.","Process Makes Perfect","2013-08-21 00:00:47"

Hey guys, Brooke here—resident Word Doc at Current360 and first-time blogger. Not surprisingly, I’ve noticed that most of my coworkers’ blog posts are a combination of their personal interests and the ad world. Makes sense, right? Well, in an effort to not disrupt flow, I’ve decided to discuss idol worshiping on Instagram. Now hold up, I’m not saying I take a personal interest in idol worshiping, but I know a lot of people out there do.

Instagram is currently my only social media outlet and I’ve noticed more and more celebrities are joining in on the fun—something Facebook wasn’t too big on. But, with more celebrities comes more celebrity followers. People everywhere are dying over first-hand glimpses into a stranger’s world, especially if it’s a stranger they admire. I think most of us are guilty of following a person or two we admire, but what I don’t understand, was why people are “liking” these celebrities’ pictures, commenting on them and so on. I don’t get it. Or at least is didn’t until I found <i>Enjoy Cupcakes.</i>

In 2008 BI (before Instagram), I started a cupcake business out of my kitchen. Since then, I’ve been continuing to expand my menu and my business. Five years and a cupcake surge later, I still haven’t seen a dessert with the same style or uniqueness as mine. Enter <a href=""http://enjoycupcakes.com/""><i>Enjoy Cupcakes</i></a>. My cupcakery—and now Instagram—idol from Los Olivos, Ca. I love everything about them, their marketing, creativity, shabby chicness and–oh my God—their retro trailers for events are to die for!

I recently started following them on Instagram and I get it now! I want to “like”, comment, regram, lick the screen, whatever gets me noticed. I just love them, and I’m not ashamed to say I’m insta-obsessed with my instaidol.

So keep up the stalking people and maybe you’ll find your #instaidol too.","Instagram Idol","2013-09-05 09:04:09"

The words are accompanied by moving shapes and lines, which help to keep it interesting as well as fell a particular word. For instance, take the transition between the words “delight” and “surprise” as the word changes the background changes from black to white, adding a visual element of surprise.

The graphics are what initially drew me to this spot, but what really helped hold water for me was the sound design and foley. If you watch the spot with the sound turned off, its easy to see just how much the sound helps sell the black dots moving like bouncy balls. The sound effects under the motion graphics are also extremely high quality and crisp sounding, which really work well with the brand. The ending is even more fitting for an all motion graphic spot, because Apple’s signature is not typical cursive font. “Designed by Apple in California” is unique and can be found on just about any one of their products. These are all of the minute details combined together to create a perfect piece, something that usually cannot be managed unless given to a team of people passionate for perfection in their work. In my opinion, the people at Buck who helped create this spot got everything right.","Motion Graphics That Move You","2013-08-29 09:01:44"

As a programmer new to Ruby who has recently debunked the <a href=""http://current360.com/play/all-this-great-stuff-about-ruby/"">command line tools issue when starting with Ruby on a Mac</a> you are now ready to begin in earnest your Ruby on Rails or RoR (you know how us Geeks love our acronyms) coding career.

The MVC programming pattern is used in Ruby on Rails and it can be a little confusing if you are new to programming in general or a veteran coder. The acronym M-V-C stands for Model-View-Controller and each has a specific function for your web application.
<ul>
	<li>Model – Contains application data, logic, rules, functions</li>
	<li>View – The visual representation of said data, rules, logic, etc.</li>
	<li>Controller – Mediator between the Model and View</li>
</ul>
<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ruby-chart.jpg""><img alt=""Ruby chart"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ruby-chart.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

If that seems a bit abstract to you let’s think of it in another way.  View – it’s your eyes. You see what is going on. What do you do with those visual elements? You pass them along your Controller / central nervous system until they get to your Model / brain.

So let’s say that your View is a large, angry looking ferret staring you down with its dark, beady eyes. After your controller has sent that data to your Model it will most likely tell you do adjust your view by turning and moving in a rapid speed in a different direction.

After you have eluded the wily ferret your View is a lovely picnic in front of a pristine lake. Your controller sends this new data to your Model and it decides to sit down and have a delicious avocado sandwich.

Now your view is that you are out of avocado sandwiches (oh no!). So you pass that data along the Controller to your Model which decides to go home (I mean what’s the point if you don’t have avocado right?)

If that analogy didn’t sit well with you perhaps a webpage will. The HTML would be the Model, the CSS the View and the browser the Controller.

This is my long-winded way of telling you that the Model is the data, logic, or information of your program. The View is the visual representation of it and the Controller is the traffic cop that directs them.

Hopefully this helps you understand the MVC pattern a little better and I will be back next month to continue our journey.","Ruby on Rails: The Beginning","2013-08-30 12:27:22"

One of the <a href=""http://current360.com/play/do-do-do-what-you-want/"" target=""_blank"">first blog entries</a> I wrote here at Current360 (then CurrentMarketing) was about making time to do the things you love, in my case that was drawing.  That was almost 3 years ago and needless to say I have not carried on as well as I wished.  Simple things like taking a half hour to sit down and draw are quickly pushed to the side to make way for the demands of an increased workload, some quality family time, mowing the lawn and sometimes even trying to go to sleep at a decent hour.  When you factor in the realities of everyday life finding an extra half hour can be easier said than done.

So recently when one of our clients asked to have a cast of stylized characters developed, a group with more of a hand-drawn feel, I was excited to be involved.  After all what’s the best way to get a stylized hand-drawn feel?  You guessed it, draw them by hand.  Pencil and paper, yes!  Love it!  I keep telling myself I need to find free time to start drawing again so this is a gift.  To me there is something therapeutic about turning away from my computer monitor, picking up a pencil and putting graphite on paper.  At a certain point I know that the sketches will migrate from paper to computer, but for now it’s completely unplugged.

I’m not sure whether it’s tight deadlines or just the ease of using the computer programs that cause the actual act of sketching ideas to be skipped over.  It always feels like the right way to start working through the design process.  You can look at someone’s sketches and see such a great creative variety of ideas come out in the brainstorming process .  On paper you can follow a more complete history of the development and evolution of the ideas, the odd ideas, the far fetched and outrageous ideas. Then you’ll see an idea that has merit and it’s carried through multiple stages of refinement, from a loose sketch to a great idea ready to be taken into the digital world. I alway like to keep my brainstorming sketches.  Sometimes the sketches can be really helpful in other tasks.  They can help break through a creative block or could even have an idea that may work in a different way on another project.

So, back to the first point. Sketching characters for our client has reminded me of my initial pledge to draw more.  I’m renewing my pledge.  I’ll let you know how it goes.","Sketches of Chaney","2013-09-03 08:21:41"

As a social media intern, I thought I would reflect on my summer without Facebook. The reason for my Facebook deactivation was for sorority recruitment. This summer I served as a Gamma Chi, otherwise known as a recruitment counselor, for sorority recruitment at the University of Louisville. As Gamma Chi’s, we are to provide an unbiased opinion and be able to help girls through the recruitment process without persuading them towards a certain sorority. Girls can very easily find out what you’re in through your social media profiles. The best way to assure no one found out what sorority I’m in was to privatize Twitter and Instagram, delete any pins associated with my sorority and to deactivate Facebook.

We deactivated back in April and let me tell you, it was not easy! One concern I had was my Klout score...but that quickly dissipated. Another tough realization was that I could no longer be retweeted. There’s nothing more exciting than a perfect tweet that gets multiple retweets by friends.

A problem the Gamma Chi’s ran into was that when we made our Gamma Chi pages on Facebook, we were accused of being spam and Facebook put us on a 30 day probation. What happened was we could log in and see everything, but we weren’t able to friend request, comment, like, or share! Due to our lack of friends, other than each other, we banned from any interaction because we were apparently not real people.

The glorious return to Facebook has been quite enjoyable. I have over 50 friends on my newsfeed, I have notifications daily and I’m allowed to interact. Something that I realized this summer was how much Facebook keeps me in the loop. I hate to say it, but birthdays were forgotten without Facebook’s reminder. I felt pretty left out all summer without being updated on my friends lives!

I had a pretty adventurous summer – I turned 21, went to Vegas and went to Disney – but I couldn’t share the awesome pictures or tell the funny stories. Needless to say, I’m happy to be reactivated. I am pretty ashamed to say that Facebook plays that big of a part in my life-keeping me informed of my friends birthdays, social events, etc. It was a big change this summer but I definitely saw how much of my life depends on that one website!","My Summer Without Facebook","2013-09-06 10:09:29"

In today’s digital age, your website is often the face of your business. It can make the first impression, develop leads and generate sales. Given its vital role in your success, it is critical that it effectively communicate and fortify your brand.

So how can you tell if your website is performing at its peak? Could it benefit from a slight cosmetic update or does it need a more strategic overhaul? Below are a few questions to help you decide.

<strong>Is your website a road map or a maze?
</strong>Is your website easy to navigate? Nothing on your website should be more than three clicks from the home page. That requires a well-planned site map with content that is organized in a manner that makes sense to the viewer. If people can’t find what they are looking for on your site, they’ll look elsewhere.

<strong>Is your website lost or found?
</strong>Is your site optimized for search engines? With more than five billion searches queried on Google every day, more than likely a prospect is searching for your product or services. If you’re not showing up in the search results, you can bet your competition is.

<strong>Is your website looking fine at any size?
</strong>Is your website employing responsive web design (RWD)? The surge in tablet and smart phone popularity has resulted in a dramatic drop in the use of PCs. RWD ensures that your website looks its best whether it’s viewed on a desktop, smart phone or tablet.

<strong>Is your website dynamic or dated?
</strong>Does your website have a contemporary design? Since viewers are looking for current, relevant content, they’ll choose a contemporary looking website over a dated site any day. Modern websites are designed with higher resolutions to fit larger PC monitors, larger bolder images and more engaging content that viewers want to read and share.

<strong>Is your website mobile or stuck?
</strong>Does your website require users to complete forms or make purchases? If so, a dedicated mobile site is recommended since 76% of surveyed consumers said they wouldn’t bother using a site not optimized for mobile and 30% would turn to a competitor’s site that was. Mobile optimized sites are designed for faster download speed, easier navigation, and require less expanding and shrinking of content resulting in a greater user experience.

<strong>Is your website anti-social?
</strong>Are you savvy enough to be taking advantage of the branding power of social media? If so, your website should feature social media icons with links to your pages to increase customer engagement.

How well did your website stand up to these six simple questions? As website design and development experts, Current 360 can ensure that your website is an asset to your brand and a stellar member of your marketing and sales team.","Can Your Website Stand Up to Six Simple Questions?","2013-09-17 08:47:12"

And so I am reiterating the importance of such. You see, earlier in my career I didn't put much value on rationales. Maybe it was because of the quality of the ones that I had been subjected to. But I now realize the potential. Regardless of how experienced the account exec may be, I believe it is vital for the client to hear the designer's thought process and reasoning. I have found that it can mean the difference between a beautiful project and one that spirals wildly out of control. A thoughtful, expressive rationale even helps fend off pesky, scope-creep-induced rounds of revisions.

So the next time you are tasked with writing a design rationale, embrace it. Think of it as your chance as a creative professional to show off your expertise.","The Art of Design Rationales","2013-09-18 09:00:25"

So you need a Google map? Here's where to start.

The Google maps V2 api was officially deprecated May 19, 2010. Since then the deprecation period has been extended until November 19, 2013 (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/"" target=""_blank"">source</a>). After November 19, v2 requests will be served a special wrapped version of the v3 api instead, which Google expects will work for most simple maps.

So if you've got an old map running it's a good time to jump into v3 and upgrade. A nice thing about the v3 api is that it doesn't require an api key. You only need one if you want to capture data on usage of your map application, which can be viewed from your <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/console"">code.google.com/apis/console</a> page.

So in order to get your map running without an api key, use the following when calling your map:
<pre>&lt;script src=&quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp&amp;sensor=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

The most important thing to note is that there is no api variable being sent over. Just v=3.exp and a value for sensor (true or false). A good example to look at is the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple"" target=""_blank"">simple map</a> featured in the api documentation. No api key needed.

Now that you've seen a simple map example, in my next post I'll show how to add map markers to the example until then follow the Google docs.","So you need a Google map?","2013-09-19 09:25:45"

Raise your hand if you're obsessed with J. Crew! I'll put both of my hands in the air for good measure. It seems that I've caught the J. Crew fever and I'm not the only one. A once tired and lost brand has been completely revamped and is sweeping the nation.

Sales have doubled in the last seven years for the company in spite of the recession and an expansion plan overseas is in the works. Vice President and Creative Director of the company, Jenna Lyons, is a genius in my opinion and continues to move J. Crew forward with designs that customers love. She's also taken bold moves to set the company apart from others. One of those bold moves includes debuting the recent Fall Collection via <a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/jcrew/sept-style-guide/"" target=""_blank"">Pinterest</a>.

I am an avid Pinterest curator (yes, curator) and was ecstatic to discover that J. Crew would be debuting their Fall Collection on the social platform. Needless to say the night before the launch (August 18) I dreamed of merino wool skirts, peacoats and cashmere sweaters.

Pinterest is so interactive and allows users to pin things they want and revisit them later. The pins never disappear off my boards so I've come to think of them as my fashion sticky notes- reminders of outfit inspirations for a later date. As with a lot of boards on Pinterest, items are aspirational which is a category J. Crew would love to be in. What brand wouldn't want to be on someone's little luxaries board?

From an advertising stand point, a perk of debuting a collection on Pinterest is the fact that you can see immediate response from customers. It almost acted as a focus group because the company could see what would be the best-sellers and receive real-time feedback and that wouldn't be the case if they had simply rolled out the collection on their website.

Other brands are catching on and are debuting collections via social media. Late this summer Oscar de la Renta debuted their collection via Instagram.

Working in social media is one thing. I get to work hands on with the social field and dive into what it takes to maintain a brand image online. But having a college course strictly on social media is a whole new world!

Comm 460: Social Media, is one of those, or you probably won’t get to take it. It’s a very popular course and I now see why – and I’m only 2 weeks into the semester.

The best part of this are each assigned a group and have our own client that we will strategize for and create an entire social media campaign and present to the client at the end of the semester. A huge portion of my entire grade is based off of something that I’m lucky to work hands on with at work.

A rewarding aspect of all of this is that I am seeing how much I’ve learned from work in the” I was maybe the only hand raised. I feel like I’m constantly raising my hand and knowing the answers – yes, I’m one of <em>THOSE</em> students. I’ve learned my lesson and shied away from admitting all I know. It’s happened a few times where my professor will bring up a topic and I’ll relate it back to a social media campaign by another brand and she says “that’s just what I was getting to!”

Something we will be using and graded on is HootSuite University. This is a program through HootSuite where college students are given all sorts of tools and quizzes they must complete in order to receive HootSuite certification. Looks like I get to add another section to my Skills &amp; Expertise on LinkedIn!

I can easily say that this favorite college courses. I mostly am looking forward to a semester of lessons that I will be able to incorporate into my everyday time here at work. I guess I’m finally at that point in my college career where I’m enjoying learning because I can see it being used in real life – unlike that time I took Enjoyment of Theatre Arts.","Comm 460: Social Media","2013-09-23 10:35:33"

I watched a segment on the Saturday Morning Early Show on the growing popularity of audio books. They even made mention that a lot of authors are thinking of doing audio books instead of having their stories published in print.

I can remember back in my childhood, how important it was to read a book. I can remember buying children story books with CDs so my sons could listen to the stories while they were looking at the books.  It would capture their interest as they turned the pages of what was coming next in the story.

Could audio books hurt our children in reading?  Or will it inspire them to ""read more,"" even if it means pressing play on their iPod. My sons, to this day, don't like to read a book, especially if they can listen to it.  What happens if your child needs to do a book report? Will they wait until the day before its due so they could listen to the audio and summarize what they heard instead of reading the material?

Will it make them slow readers?

We are already having problems with people driving and texting.  Won't the audio books be another distraction, especially if you listened to it while driving?","Audio Books: Boon or Bane?","2013-09-30 09:24:51"

Next time you are flipping through you favorite magazine and are annoyed with all the ads you have to get through just to read the content, you better check yourself!  If it wasn't for those ads you wouldn't be able to afford your favorite magazine, like one of my favorites, Vogue.

There is currently a <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/ad-free-issue-september-vogue-engineering-marvel-it-will-cost-you-152790"" target=""_blank"">listing on Craigslist</a> for Vogue with out the advertisements and it goes for a whooping $4 million dollars.  Yep, you heard right.  Someone went through calculated the ads and figured out what the cost of the $12 issue would be without them.  I knew that the ads made the magazine much more affordable but didn't know it was that much.

Recently I was lucky enough to be involved in a project where I was been asked to create illustrated cartoon characters. I’ve always enjoyed the process of illustrating. As a kid I used to spend hours drawing monster trucks and animals. I can still visualize the thick, off-white paper and the feel of crayons and pencils as I dragged them heavily across the rough surface on the sheet.

Well things have definitely changed. When it comes to illustration projects here at the agency the pencil and paper are just the beginning brainstorming and development stage, before it was the beginning AND the end. One thing is the same. I still enjoy the process and find it rewarding to see the finished piece.

I was recently talking with a friend here at C360 and he mentioned he would like to know how take his sketches from paper to digital, so I thought I would give a condensed tutorial on how I create digital illustrations. Here it goes.

<strong>Step 1: Sketches.</strong>

Draw something. This is the o.g. pencil and paper stage. Brainstorm and get your ideas out and onto the paper. It doesn’t matter how rough or messy the sketches are during this stage of the process. You’re just trying to get something you like.

<strong>Step 2: Ink.</strong>

After you have something you like it needs to be cleaned up and prepped for scanning.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-A.jpg""><img alt=""illustration-A"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-A.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""375"" /></a>

There are a few things that really help make this step easy: tracing paper and good artist pens, usually a brush tip and a fine tip will suffice. Trace the original drawing. When using the pens try to retain all the variations within the lines. Try to use the brush tip pen with varying pressure in order to keep the hand drawn look of the original lines. Redrawing with ink will create a better image when scanning.

<strong>Step 3: Scan.</strong>

This step is pretty self explanatory. Just make sure your scanning at a good resolution (300dpi).

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-B.jpg""><img alt=""illustration-B"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-B.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""375"" /></a>

<strong>Step 4: Photoshop.</strong>

Here is were a few expensive programs begin to make things a bit easier (or more complicated, depends on how how you look at it.) Open the file of the scanned illustration using Photoshop. There are two things to try to accomplish during this step.

First, try to adjust levels to achieve truer whites and blacks. There are a few ways to do this. Here’s one way to try. In the menu bar choose image&gt; Mode &gt; greyscale. Then add a curves or levels adjustment layer. You find adjustment layers through the menu bar, Layer &gt;new adjustment layer &gt; curves, or by opening an adjustments window through the window menu bar option. Toy around with the adjustment layer until you’ve achieved pretty clean whites and sharp blacks. The trick is to find the right balance and not distort the illustration.

The second step is to separate the illustration into sections or groups. An example of what I mean by this would be to put hair, face, arms, legs, &amp; body on separate layers. This isn’t a necessary step. It just makes things a little easier later when it comes to color or positioning.

<strong>Step 5: Illustrator.</strong>

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-01-at-2.50.16-PM.png""><img alt=""Screen Shot 2013-10-01 at 2.50.16 PM"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-01-at-2.50.16-PM.png"" width=""599"" height=""370"" /></a>

Now it’s time to convert the illustration into a vector format. This will allow for the illustration to be resized without loss of resolution and make it easier to add color. Open a new file in illustrator. Using the photoshop file that you have been working on select a layer and drag it onto the new illustrator window (it’s easiest if you have both files open and positioned next to each other so that you can view both at the same time). The image should then appear on the illustrator page. In the illustrator menu bar select window &gt;image trace. This will open up a small option window tracing the image. This window contains a variety of preset tracing options. Select the image to be traced and them in the image trace window select the option of black and white logo. Hit the trace button at the bottom of the window. The image is now vector, but you can you can’t change any of its characteristics until you expand it. If you have the image selected you will see an expand button in the top menu bar. Select that button and presto! Individual, editable objects are created.

<strong>Step 6: Color.</strong>

This is the last step. Select the image (should be grouped together) and in the menu bar select object &gt;live trace &gt;make. Now using the live paint tool (accessible in the tool bar) you can add color fills to the illustration. By hovering over the illustration with the live paint tool particular areas/objects will be highlighted. If you click on the area while highlighted it will fill that object with the color selected.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-c.jpg""><img alt=""illustration-c"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/illustration-c.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""375"" /></a>One thing to note. Usually after tracing an image there will be a large white frame around the entire illustration. This is the part of the art board from photoshop. You can do two things to eliminate this. First using the direct select tool you can choose a corner point and hit the delete button twice or using the direct select tool, select a corner point and choose no fill in the color palette. Both will remove the large white frame. If you like, add some highlights and shadows and then you’re done.

There you have it from paper to digital. This may seem a bit confusing the first time you attempt it, but after a couple times you’ll be able to fly through these steps like an old pro.

As an NFL fan (Go Colts!) that just happens to be a woman, I have a tendency to roll my eyes at the commercials that I’m accustomed to seeing every week during game day. Scantily clad women in commercials are everywhere. I get it. Men are the primary audience (but not by much!) and men love seeing scantily clad women.  But when the NFL rolled out their new <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuNowQLA_s"" target=""_blank"">2013-2014 campaign for their Women’s Apparel line</a>, it turned my head. I knew it wasn’t your typical commercial with the typical game day bikini babes. Nope. This commercial depicts strong women athletes, mothers and career women.  The 30 second spot includes NFL athlete’s wives, fashion bloggers and professional female athletes. The voice over features a 2009 motivational speech from Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh. He does a great job motivating because I was so motivated after seeing the commercial that I went straight to the <a href=""www.nflshop.com/womens"" target=""_blank"">website</a> to check out their new offerings. Check out the spot for yourself and see what you think!

<em>*Side note - Clearly the NFL did a great job of marketing this commercial to women because when I asked Jimmy D (who watches A LOT of football) if he had seen the commercial, he had no idea what I was talking about. Apparently there aren’t enough bikini babes in it for his liking. </em>","NFL: The F stands for female","2013-10-04 08:49:59"

Fifty years ago, when advertising masterminds like David Ogilvy ruled the advertising kingdom, ads contained more text than most blog posts do today.  There’s no mistaking that he was, as TIME described him, “the most sought-after advertising wizard in today’s advertising industry.”

After all, he was responsible for iconic spokesmen such as the Marlboro man and the eye patch wearing man in the Hathaway shirt, and the tagline “Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream” which propelled Dove to become the best-selling soap in the US.   Regardless of the product, his ads were notorious for columns of copy resembling a page from the Wall Street Journal.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Think_Small.jpg""><img alt=""Think_Small"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Think_Small.jpg"" width=""394"" height=""500"" /></a>

But how well Ogilvy would have adapted to today’s digital and overly mobile world where attention spans have been shrunk to the size of chick peas?   Even Doyle Dane Bembach’s minimalist 1962 Volkswagen ad with the <b>“Think Small”</b> headline and the tiny image of the Beetle surrounded by a disproportionate amount white space contained 140 words of text.

Reimagined, that same ad today might contain the same headline and image (why mess with a great thing?), a few social media icons (#VW #thinksmall), a QR code that links to a YouTube video and a web address.

The cold hard reality is that a consumer’s attention is always being courted by brands eager to make a sale – from traditional media (TV, radio, print, direct mail and outdoor) to less traditional (online ads, blogs, podcasts, and emails).    A brand message has mere seconds to capture an audience’s attention and peak their interest.  Therefore your messaging must be spot on and captivating.  Forget Think small – you have to <b>Think WOW</b>!

I can only imagine what goes into planning a wedding. I heard on the radio yesterday that when you purchase a ring from Shane Company, you’ll get a membership to <a href=""http://www.shaneco.com/WeddingClub/Default.htmx?nid=GN_Engagement_Banner_WeddingClub"" target=""_blank"">The Wedding Club</a>. It sounds like a pretty helpful tool. Brides will have access to discounts from local vendors, the option to build a free website, receive invitations to special events and get access to budgeting, planning and organization tools.

I think it’s a pretty cool perk for Shane Co. to offer, but I see one flaw with the radio advertisement. Traditionally, the guys is the one to buy the ring, and the girl is the one concerned with the planning. So will this ad speak to him? Does he care about all the free advice that comes with a Shane Company ring? Maybe they’re counting on girls like me, that will hopefully nudge their boyfriends in the right direction. My first thought was, “how do I slip this into a conversation?” Either way, it’s a cool bonus for Shane Company’s clients.","More Than Just The Ring","2013-10-23 09:47:16"

If I were an advertiser running spots at your local cinema, I might be afraid of the fact that over half of Americans now have smartphones. Instead, a group of studious people at a university in Germany think advertisers should be afraid of  – popcorn! A study that has been released this week indicates that apparently a lot of people don’t have the ability to listen and chew at the same time.

The report describes the disruption of “inner speech” that occurs when one is chomping down on America’s favorite movie snack. For instance, when you hear or read a name like Heath Slocumb your inner speech subconsciously tries to pronounce that name and according to the University of Cologne, chewing on popcorn disallows the consumer from hearing that inner speech.

I don’t deny the logic, how many times have you been trying to eat a bag of chips, have a conversation with someone and have to stop chewing to hear what they say? However, these studies are always done with such controlled variables – here you go, this half gets free popcorn and this half doesn’t. When you’re finished, I’m going to give you guys a quiz and see who paid more attention. It doesn’t come to any shock to me that the people busy with popcorn paid less attention to the commercials than the people with none.

While things like chatty friends, smartphones and pregame snacks will continue to be distractions to moviegoers, cinematic advertising still proves to be successful. After all, everyone’s seat is facing towards your ad, it’s displayed on the biggest screen in the room and everyone has chosen to be there. It’s the perfect setup.

Finding a link between all of the “distractions” might be the key for advertisers – perhaps interactive ads that offer consumers a discount on their beverage or snack for participating? Sounds like a win for everyone to me. Six dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids is just that – sour.

Recently I learned a valuable lesson while transferring a Wordpress site from a development domain to the live domain.

The theme was written using the built in Text Widgets for both the sidebar and footer widget areas containing everything from navigation menus to scrolling sponsor logos. We were taking advantage of all four widget locations in both the sidebar and footer, as you can imagine there was a good amount of HTML/CSS/JS in the individual text widgets.

Once we had finalized the sites and were switching everything over to the live domain when the database updates were finalizing there was a known error that causes the text widgets contents to not be ported to the live domain.

After a significant amount of time searching on Google there were no known solutions to this problem other than being aware of it and saving your text widget contents in a text file doing the domain transfer and then repopulating the content.

Hope this helps save someone some time!","Wordpress Text Widget Update Error","2013-10-29 09:00:24"

Hyundai, an early-adopter sponsor of the <i>infectiously</i> popular show The Walking Dead, piggybacked the 4<sup>th</sup> season’s episode premiere to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KihE3IyHNPI"" target=""_blank"">launch their interactive app</a> that allows you to design your very own zombie-proof survival machine.

It’s a great idea to incorporate Hyundai into The Walking Dead experience while creating engagement with the viewers, but as I watched the commercial, I felt their call-to-action fell WAY short of the mark.

<i>“Build your own Hyundai zombie survival machine at WalkingDeadChopShop.com”</i>

So, I go to the website and build my version of the best zombie survival machine. That’s it? I design it…look at it…then, done? I don’t get to fight zombies with it. I don’t get to drive it around a post-apocalyptic city. Is there any incentive for me to take part in this beside my desire to see what a chainsaw and flame-thrower look like attached to a two-door, hatchback Hyundai?

This is where I think Hyundai got it wrong. Apparently there <i>is </i>a contest and there <i>is</i> a winner to be announced. It took some digging (through YouTube and other articles), and I found the creators of The Walking Dead will select a winning design that will be built and unveiled at New York’s Comic-Con. Furthermore, fans can enter into the “Survive and Drive” sweepstakes to win a zombie-proof 2014 Hyundai Tucson. Now <i>that’s</i> something that will create participation. Who would want a zombie-proof machine as this imminent zombie apocalypse everyone keeps talking about is <i>obviously </i>right around the corner.

Why wouldn’t Hyundai explicitly state these points in the commercial or prominently highlight them on the homepage of the WalkingDeadChopShop.com website where they’re driving viewers to?

In addition to my issue of the call-to-action, Hyundai is driving viewers to WalkingDeadChopShop.com only to send them away from the website to download the app at the iTunes App Store or Google Play App Store. This extra step doesn’t seem like a huge burden, but why have the extra step at all?

So there’s my rambling about Hyundai’s commercial that partnered with a show that I’ve watched religiously with my friends through the past three seasons. You can agree or disagree with me.

In the end, I feel Hyundai’s campaign was short-sided, not well thought out, and poorly executed. With 16.1 million viewers watching The Walking Dead’s 4<sup>th</sup> season premiere…creating some type of consumer involvement of even a fraction of that 16.1 million would deem this campaign a success for Hyundai. We’ll see.","Hyundai Zombie Ad Needs More Brains","2013-10-31 08:23:09"

My latest post is all about the Benjamins, baby, and for those of you who are getting bored of staring at their same old hundred dollar bills – good news! There's a new hundo in town. Benjamin Franklin is finally getting the facelift he deserves! These freshly designed $100 bills started making their way into circulation yesterday, and although they might not appear to be all that radically different from our old bills, these new Benji’s have a ton of sophisticated anti-counterfeiting technology going on under the hood.

Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about the bill's new makeover that's hitting your wallet this week:
<ol>
	<li><strong>The feel of the bill is texturally different.</strong> For the first time, the engraving process includes the effect of ""raised printing."" This ""can be felt throughout the $100 note, and gives genuine U.S. currency its distinctive texture,"" a government website on the design changes says. On the note, around the left shoulder of Benjamin Franklin is where you can detect the raised printing the most. This form of printing on the bill is supposed to make it harder for counterfeiters to copy and easier for the public – and store cashiers – to authenticate.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-17424-1381205064-0.jpg""><img-buzz-17424-1381205064-0"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-17424-1381205064-0.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""289"" /></a></p>
</li>
	<li><strong>There's a new blue security ribbon to the left of Franklin's head.</strong> No, surprisingly this is not a printing goof. It's actually designed as another security feature for the bill. If you tilt the paper, the designs along the strip change from Liberty Bells to the number ""100"" in moving patterns. Something neat about this is that the ribbon has nothing to do with the actual printing, instead it's woven onto the paper.
<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-18127-1381204869-0.jpg""><img-buzz-18127-1381204869-0"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-18127-1381204869-0.jpg"" width=""409"" height=""196"" />
</a></li>
	<li><strong>A shiny new copper-colored bell is in the inkwell icon.</strong> This new icon is rendered in another non-green hue, a copper-colored inkwell. When the bill is tilted back and fourth, the bell shifts from copper to green - which makes yet another security feature for the bill.
<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/grid-cell-5917-1381213911-1.jpg""><img-cell-5917-1381213911-1"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/grid-cell-5917-1381213911-1.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""247"" />
</a></li>
	<li><strong>A quill pen appears above the inkwell to represent the Founding Fathers signing the Declaration of Independence.
<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-2620-1381208353-0.jpg""><img-buzz-2620-1381208353-0"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/enhanced-buzz-2620-1381208353-0.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""334"" /></a>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Probably the most notable change is a large gold 100 that's featured on the back.</strong> The large 100 on the back of the bill is meant to help those with visual impairment and easily read the denomination.</li>
</ol>
Other new features on the new bill include a security thread that when held to the light you'll see an embedded thread that runs vertically on the bill. The thread is imprinted with the letters USA and 100. The new note is also printed on special paper which includes red and blue security fibers, and is one-fourth linen and three fourths cotton. The new bills will only be printed in two locations, Washington, D.C. and Fort Worth, Texas. You can tell where the bill was printed because if it has a small F.W. in the top left corner it was printed in Fort Worth, if it has no indicator it was printed in D.C.

From a design standpoint, the bill seems quite cluttered with verbiage, images, and a new thick blue line running down the center that isn't so attractive to the eye. But with all currency, security trumps design, and this new design is all about stopping potential counterfeiters in their tracks. What do YOU think about the new bill design and the high-tech security features?","The $100 Facelift","2013-11-11 08:27:14"

If you have not already tried the highly targeted and cost-effective world of Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising, it’s time to dip your toe in the digital pool. Benefits of PPC advertising include a small investment to get started, complete control over your monthly budget, ability to track results and target specific geographic areas, and you only pay when someone is interested and clicks on your ad. Compare that with a newspaper ad that you pay full price for regardless if anyone wants your book, “<a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/crafting-with-cat-hair-kaori-tsutaya/1100184559"" target=""_blank"">Crafting with Cat Hair</a>.” Yes, people, that is a thing! But, before you leap off the 15 meter diving platform and cannonball into the world of internet marketing, follow these five tips to maximize your PPC’s ROI.

<strong>1. Run a negative campaign
</strong>Negative keywords are the most underused features offered for PPC campaigns. Negative keywords are words that are often associated with your topic but are completely irrelevant to your product. By employing negative keywords, you can prevent your ad from appearing and receiving worthless clicks. For example, when marketing “Crafting with Cat Hair,” add “allergies,” “removal” and “shedding” to your negative keyword list to reduce your clicks and save your PPC dollars.

<strong>2. Location, location, location
</strong>Google and Bing offer geo-location features, which allow you to target geographic markets based on IP addresses, geo-specific keywords or both, giving you the ability to target Calico, CA, Tabby Island, GA, Kitty Hawk, NC or anyplace in between.

<strong>3. Curiosity won’t kill this cat
</strong>Pique your prospects’ interest by offering value and then capitalizing on it with a clear call-to-action. Use terms like “Learn More” and “Free Download” to draw in customers. For instance, when marketing “Crafting with Cat Hair” you might want to offer a free psychiatric evaluation.

<strong>4. Utilize long tail keywords
</strong>Long tail keywords are three-to-four-word phrases that are specific to your product. Visitors using very specific search phrases are often further along in the purchasing process and can result in a higher conversion rate. For example, use “Crafting with Cat Hair” instead of just “crafting,” “cat,” or “hair.”

<strong>5. A homepage is not a landing page
</strong>When tossed in the air, it is said that a cat will always land on its feet. However, a prospect who clicks on your ad should not land on your website’s home page. Like a cat chasing a laser beam, consumers confuse easily and are easily distracted. Deliver them to a landing page that picks up right where your PPC ad left off. Don’t lose your visitor—and potential sale—by confusing them with unnecessary content.","Five Tips for a Purrrrfect Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Campaign","2013-11-14 10:22:18"

First of all, I will say the NBA has not made any indications or public announcements saying the new sleeved jersey designs are making way for advertising opportunities. So you might say, “Michael, how could you possibly draw such a farfetched, cockamamie conclusion?” It’s not so cockamamie and here’s why:
<ul>
	<li>updated jerseys simply have more surface area</li>
	<li>logos and numbers will have neutral colors like white or grey</li>
	<li>front of jerseys will have only a logo, no numbers or city names</li>
	<li>numbers will be on the sleeves and on the back</li>
</ul>
All I’m saying is, if I were an advertiser and wanted my brand on an NBA jersey, these would be some ideal conditions – no distracting and contrasting colors and plenty of space.

We’ve become accustomed to the walking advertisements that are professional athletes. Golfers’ shirts, hats and bags are littered with name brands when they take to the course. NASCAR drivers completely cover their suits and cars with sponsors. Even professional video gamers dawn gear from their favorite energy drink brands when they play in national events. So the NBA would merely be following the trend if they truly are looking to scrape more revenue with a ‘Your Ad Here’ campaign.

There may, however, be a couple of details that poke holes in my theory. First of all, these updated jersey designs, while trendy, are far from the traditional design and may not be popular with everyone. Secondly, these are apparently going to be this year’s Christmas Day jerseys and could be the usual ploy for the NBA to get a quick boost in jersey sales. Finally, as Adidas is currently the exclusive jersey provider of the NBA, they may not take too kindly to advertisers drowning out their own logo.

Personally, I think the traditional jersey is becoming a little bit dated and the 2013 Christmas jersey is a refreshing and sleek take on the ol’ getup. Tell us what you think about the new designs. Do you think the NBA is silently pitching a proposal to would-be advertisers? Also, enjoy the NBA’s holiday spot - “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYEHUOpwNvE"" target=""_blank"">Jingle Hoops</a>,” promoting the Christmas gear.","NBA Quietly Readying New Jerseys for Advertising?","2013-11-18 11:28:40"

I am not talking about air conditioning (AC), but a new look at Atlantic City (AC). When most folks hear Atlantic City they think gambling and night life. AC wanted to change this perspective and launched a traveling road show to bigger cities for folks to enjoy first hand other things AC has to offer. supporting their recent advertising campaign, “Do AC.”

The “Do AC” campaign traveled this summer to fairs and festivals in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City. “Do AC” incorporated some traditional advertising, social media and PR.  The roadshow brought the seaside resort to life through six interactive environments that showcased hotels, nightlife and restaurants as well as its boardwalk casinos. The custom wood flooring inside was an exact replica of the famous Atlantic City Boardwalk.

One of the environment touted Spa services entitled “Do Chill” and another area “Do Views” highlighted the beautiful  Atlantic City’s ocean and bay vistas while visitors could recharge their phones.

Given that yesterday was a small victory for the social media world as Oxford Dictionary declared “selfie” the word of the year…I thought I’d write a blog geared towards Social Media.

Everyone is so eager to be connected to their friends, family, and other social circles by “checking in” at a location…by “sharing” information…by posting/tweeting a status of what they’re currently doing or thinking…or even allowing a photo with a cleverly selected filter to do the talking.

But what are the ramifications of that? Are there consequences of keeping the social media world informed and up-to-date on your every thought and action? Exactly who are you sharing this information with? Does it stop with your friends and family?...or can just anybody be in-the-know about the “selfie” you just captured while sipping your latte at your favorite local coffee joint or the amazing dish you just ate at the newest gastropub that was <i>definitely</i> Instagram-worthy.

Jack Vale explored this topic even further <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P_0s1TYpJU"">in this video</a> by finding people who are publicly posting social media updates around his location and creeps them out a little bit given <i>only</i> the information they chose to share with the social media world.

I found this hilarious and had to “share” it…uh oh…wait, what have I done? It also reminds us of the darker, spooky side of social media and to make sure our privacy settings are set up and active.

Excellent customer service these days may be seen to some as a commodity. Can you recall a recent customer service experience that was pleasant?

I recently hosted a jewelry party and had a fabulous time with friends. I can't say enough positive things about the brand and my ""stylist"" from the company! I had numerous questions and the stylist answered them all in a timely manner and bonus--enthusiastically! I also needed to exchange a ring I bought as a gift for a larger size and the stylist took control. I was emailed the shipping label for the return and a new product was sent two days later. They made the entire process easy and pain free. The company truly impressed me with their customer service and I know I'll be a supporter of their brand.

How does this story relate to advertising?

Working in the Client Services Department of our Agency affords me the opportunity to speak with many people of varying personalities throughout the day. My job is two-fold -- being the face of our company to clients and/or vendors, and being the voice of the client to our internal team.

At times, it can be challenging to effectively filter communication between clients and team members. However, answering all questions happily and patiently and making time for everyone is one of my most important responsibilities. A favorite quote of mine is, ""People may not always remember what you say, but they will remember how you made them feel."" This is so true because everyone likes to be treated with respect. Being in the service industry, word of mouth travels fast. It's vital to do our best work and ensure we are treating our client or team member with the best attitude. It will keep peace at the agency and happy clients coming back. Nothing is worse than working with people who don't seem to enjoy their job. Everybody wants to work with the fun, smart crowd. Here at Current360, we do that.","The Hottest Commodity","2013-11-25 10:36:05"

As a front-end developer I straddle the line between the designer and code-monkey. I don't really like to call myself a developer because it throws me into a pool with some very smart people who can write a Ruby application like they're just making a sandwich. Sometimes when I'm coding a site after receiving a finalized PSD file I'm wondering if there was an easier an better way than slicing and dicing psd comps.

One of the most widely used tools when selling a site design to the client are Photoshop compositions to help to visualize the site to the client. Photoshop comps are great, but they come with some problems. What if the client wants to see what the site will look like on an iPad, an Android phone, or even a Kindle? You're stuck making a PSD for each one, which can become a designer's nightmare to maintain and update with each iteration of the design. Photoshop is great for fixed width layouts, but can be detrimental when designing a responsive site for the rapidly growing number of devices.

Today I had an ah ha! moment after reading <a href=""http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"" target=""_blank"">Brad Frost's blog</a> about Atomic Design. It was a name for something that had been nagging me every time I coded a site after being sent another PSD comp to convert to code. Atomic design breaks web design into very basic building blocks. Pretty much every site has small elements like color schemes, inputs, buttons, labels, fonts, etc. These are your atoms, your building blocks to a site. You put these atoms to together to form tangible molecular elements like a navigation list. The molecules are assembled to form organisms, like a header and footer bar. I bet you can see where I'm headed here.

Designers pretty much already do this when putting together a PSD comp. The thing is with web design full compositions are not needed. Now there are tools available such as Foundation and Bootstrap for rapid prototyping of design iterations. Creating your atoms and assembling them together creates consistency and solid foundation for your site's identity. The future is fluid, not fixed.","Death to PSD Comps","2013-12-02 10:00:14"

Where I grew up, we didn’t have shopping malls. At least not close enough to visit more than once a year. And those trips were usually dedicated to picking out school clothes or selecting a new piece of furniture for the den. Not exactly the ideal way for a seven-year-old to spend his day. In exchange for being on my best behavior (i.e., keeping my hands out of the wishing fountain or not asking Dad too many questions when we wandered past Spencer’s gifts), I would be rewarded with a 10-minute visit to the toy store before we headed home. This was an incredibly effective form of bribery, considering the impact those 600 seconds would have on my yearly letter to Santa. The mall’s toy store had inventory that my local department store could only dream about. Sorry K-mart, you were simply no match for Children’s Palace. This was heaven with halogen lighting.

But my life forever changed one mid-November day. A routine stroll to the mailbox yielded the typical bills and sweepstakes entries…except for one heavy, rectangular mass tightly wrapped in cellophane. Is it the P volume of my <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> collection? That definitely would have helped with my paper on photosynthesis last week. No, this was something different. I ripped through the translucent binding to reveal an image of an ecstatic child opening a present filled with light. In the upper corner were the most honest words I had ever read, “Wish Book ’85.”

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wishbook-1985-2.jpg""><img-1985-2"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wishbook-1985-2.jpg"" width=""261"" height=""351"" /></a>

The <i>Sears Wish Book</i> was roughly a trillion pages and included every possible toy in the universe. I honestly believed that. And for a few precious weeks before Christmas, I would not let the book out of my sight. The days of the 10-minute toy store sprint were done. I could now weigh every possible option at my own leisure, without the worry of overlooking a single Decepticon. The once crisp pages became tattered and torn. Corners were dog-eared. SKUs were memorized. He-Man figures were circled, crossed out, then circled again in red ink. In the end, the book was a mere shadow of its former self. But the resulting letter to Santa was the most comprehensive piece of correspondence I had ever crafted. As I placed a stamp on the envelope that read “North Pole” (followed by my grandmother’s address…can’t believe I was learning about photosynthesis, but didn’t realize Santa and I shared the same ZIP code), I knew that my work was complete.

For the next few years, the <i>Sears Wish Book</i> Watch became an annual tradition in my home. And no one was more excited to see it arrive than our mailman, who would begin avoiding me and my curiosities about catalog shipping procedures well before the leaves started to change.

Sadly, the <i>Wish Book</i> could not avoid the inevitable and was overtaken by progress. Several new malls began to pop up around my town, including one with our very own Children’s Palace. Big box stores stole market share from Sears, and the extensive four-color catalog was significantly downsized. Then, the convenience of the internet finished off the <i>Wish Book</i> experience once and for all. But every year around this time, as I thumb through each day’s stack of bills and sweepstakes entries, I remember the pure excitement of an unopened <i>Sears Wish Book</i>…filled cover to cover with hope and joy and Voltron figurines.","My favorite Christmas memory?

November 16, 2004 - the day I joined Facebook.

Nine years later it’s pretty amazing I’m still on the thing, even more so that part of my career can be attributed to it. Facebook has helped me share the excitement of two college graduations, four big moves and nine birthdays (nearly 1/3 of my life). It’s provided a means of communication and comfort through Katrina, my dad’s severe health troubles and the loss of family and friends. In between, it has facilitated thousands of conversations between friends and family near and far.

My Facebook experience is just one of the billions as it nears its 10th anniversary in February 2014. Say what you will about the world’s largest social network, it’s been a pretty amazing run. But is the run coming to an end? That seems to be the question on many a marketer’s mind of late, primarily due to a recent study from the <a href=""http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Coming-and-going-on-facebook/Key-Findings.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Pew Internet and American Life Project</a>. The study found that while overall teen engagement has been stable, the youngest of users are spending less time on the network. It also reveals that the majority of users have at one point or another taken a multiweek break from the service, citing the tedium and irrelevancy of its content. Among users ages 18 to 29, the demographic that first propelled Facebook into prominence, 38% said they expected to spend less time using the site this year.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-11-19-at-10.41.47-AM.png""><img alt=""Screen Shot 2013-11-19 at 10.41.47 AM"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-11-19-at-10.41.47-AM.png"" width=""527"" height=""488"" /></a>

Some are seeing this as the writing on the wall for Facebook, and perhaps it is. The reality is that no one knows for sure. I personally think people are reading a little too much into the numbers and the social network isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. (Nearly 60% of Facebook users say the site is as important to them now as it was a year ago - for those who have left the reasons are widely varied).

That being said, it’s ridiculous for anyone to think Facebook will be around for the long term. It’s highly unlikely unless it evolves into a platform for our digital selves of the future. We can look to and compare it to MySpace, Friendster and others but Facebook faces an entirely different set of challenges as it nears the decade mark.

In the meantime, here’s what I’ll be watching:

<strong>The evolution of digital and how we consume/share
</strong>We’re evolving. They’re evolving. Erry’body evolving. But seriously, our digital consumption and habits of the future will be instrumental in the future success/failure of Facebook.

<strong>Kids and Teens</strong>
Facebook was created for college students. It became popular with kids and teens when they could finally get on it. It was cool, hip and totally new territory. But the kids of today have grown up with Facebook. It’s been around their entire life, why would they want to be on it? On top of that, they now have many more options. I’m curious to see what will happen in a few years when their needs change.

<strong>Consumer Needs</strong>
Successful social networks supplement personal needs. Right now kids and teens see their friends every day, therefore Facebook doesn’t fulfill as many needs. Snapchat, Vine and Instagram do a better job of capturing their moments. I wouldn’t be surprised, however, if the kids and teens of today look to something more “Facebook-like” in a decade, once they want to start sharing bigger thoughts, opinions and news. Whether Facebook will be there or not remains to be seen, but it’ll be something bigger than what they’re currently using.

<strong>Snapchat, Vine, Twitter and Instagram</strong>
There’s plenty of competition out there and all are worth watching. Even better, they are all worth using, depending on your needs. I personally enjoy all of these networks and still find a use for Facebook. They are not for everyone, each fits a different posting habit and audience. It’s all about using what you like.

<strong>Competition</strong>
I think it makes for a good headline or story to constantly pit Facebook against other networks but I still think there’s room for all. Why must there be one massive catchall social network? We see successful fragmenting in every other medium, so why not social networks?

<strong>The Next Facebook</strong>
What’s it going to take to bring it down? To adequately replace Facebook, something will have to come along that captures and holds the attention of the majority of your social circle. A social network isn’t worth squat if your friends aren’t there.

<strong>Facebook’s Technology (or lack thereof)</strong>
Facebook’s biggest enemy is itself. The user experience is notoriously crummy and frustrating. Everything else is irrelevant unless Facebook can improve its news feed and mobile experience, which needs to happen sooner rather than later.

What do you see as the future of Facebook? Are you done with it, considering a move anytime soon or plan to continue using as normal? How have your posting habits changed? I want to hear from you social network users!","Facebook: Nearing The Decade Mark","2013-12-04 09:39:32"

Some creatives (<i>I’ve heard…)</i> have earned a reputation for being arrogant, egotistical and even a little obnoxious. But those characteristics may have been what led them to an advertising career in the first place.

A <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187113000242"" target=""_blank"">British research study</a> recently published in the journal <i>Thinking Skill and Creativity</i> concluded that people with narcissistic tendencies are more likely to think of themselves as creative. They also tend to engage in various creative activities, including art, poetry, choreography and other forms of expression.

Of course, ad agencies can be the perfect environment for people displaying this personality trait to share their creative greatness with others.

<i>And by greatness, I mean in their own minds.</i>

The study did not prove that narcissists are more creative than others.  Their overconfidence just makes them more willing to take on creative endeavors and view their finished works with a tremendous sense of pride, whether it’s truly worthy or not.

It’s important to note that most creative people I’ve worked with are not this way. Being passionate about great work or strongly defending a concept is certainly not narcissism. That’s just a creative doing their job. Especially if they’ve had the most amazing, incredible, mind-blowing idea the world has ever seen.","The greatest blog entry in the world","2013-12-05 15:51:35"

During a stop at the local Mickey D's, to quench the thirst of my sweet tea addiction, I received change with one of the dollar bills stamped ""<a href=""http://wheresgeorge.com/"" target=""_blank"">WheresGeorge.com</a>"", so I decided to play along.

The first hit my dollar bill received was in Kalamazoo, MI in June 2012.  Then it made a stop in Detroit before landing in Louisville. This dollar bill has traveled 448 miles in 1 year, 59 days.  279 miles from its starting location.  Who says money doesn't go a long way anymore!

I find this to be an interesting idea and concept to show how money travels. Of course it only works if the folks play along.  But apparently a lot of folks play along. The website, was started in 1998 by a database consultant.

In 2000 the Secret Service stepped in and stopped the selling of the WheresGeorge.com stamp used on the bills.  Apparently the stamp is considered advertising, which is illegal on US currency.

In 2006 a documentary was made about the WheresGeorge.com and its friends, apparently there are enough friends to have that they have ""Friends of WheresGeorge"" gatherings.

So when you receive your bill with the WheresGeorge stamp, play along, and watch how fast &amp; far your money can go.","Follow that Dollar","2013-12-06 10:00:43"

As the semester is wrapping up, I thought I would look at my Social Media course and the overall impact it has had during my time as an intern. A requirement of thisCertified through HootSuite University. What does this mean? Well, I had a series of 13 videos to watch giving the lowdown on social media. After you complete the video, there’s an exam over the videos. Now the frustrating part about this is that if you miss two questions, you technically fail the exam. In order to be HootSuite certified, you have to pass all of the exams. Once you finish those, you are taken to the final certification exam. Here it’s a recap of everything you’ve learned. After becoming certified, you get a nice little badge to add to your social spaces!

The biggest aspect of my entire social media course was our My professors last name, with our semester year. Whenever fun finds, etc., that were relevant to our hashtag. By utilizing our new HootSuite skills, it was clear that HootSuite was the essential hub for communicating with each other. Although there wasn’t much time during by following this hashtag and taking time each week to look at my, it was basically an onlineOn campus, I serve as the president of a club. After using HootSuite not only while working but in organization and central location of tweets.

Aside from my social media course, I’m also taking: Effects of Mass Media, German, Advanced Speech Communication and Diversity and Inequality. It’s crazy to think of all the ways these here interning. With Effects of Mass Media, I’ve learned more of the inside of advertising and what ways people are targeted. Advanced Speech Communication has helped me overcome my fear of public speaking! It still makes me really nervous, but here I’ve had to work on getting to know strangers, complete a partner speech as well as a group speech.

All in all, it’s been a fast paced and crazy semester. Now that I’m in finals season, I can only think of one thing from The Hunger Games...“May the odds be ever in your favor.”

“There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.”

In advertising, there was also a time. A time before digital, social media, product placement, viral videos, experiential marketing, advertainment….when to promote a major motion picture release you simply printed a movie poster and bought national TV. As a marketer and a big fan of the original Anchorman movie, I’ve been following with interest and enthusiasm the unique path that the Anchorman 2 movie has taken to build buzz prior to the December 18<sup>th</sup> release.  A few of the more “out-of-the-box” tactics include:

Chrysler cast the ""Ron Burgundy"" character as its pitchman for the 2014 Dodge Durango SUV. Chrysler and Paramount claim it's the first time a marketer and movie studio have used a star in character to create original long and short-form content. The automaker and their agency Weiden &amp; Kennedy turned over almost full creative control to Will Ferrell and his team.  Early returns are showing an incredible 36% sales increase during November. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/dodge?feature=watch"" target=""_blank"">Check it out</a> – funny stuff.

In another tie-in, ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's have developed a limited edition variety of their frozen yogurt named “Scotchy Scotch Scotch” after a The new flavor contains butterscotch ice cream with ribbons of butterscotch swirl. Unfortunately, it contains no actual scotch.

Speaking of Scotch, Riviera Imports has announced a new Ron Burgundy-branded Scotch called ""Great Odin's Raven Special Reserve."" Bottled in Scotland, the 40 percent ABV Scotch blend is made with whiskies from Speyside, Highlands, and Islay, and will sell for about $25 a bottle.

The beauty of these promotions, especially the Scotch and Dodge examples, is that not only do they drive opening weekend numbers but the studio is likely receiving a hefty licensing fee. Pay me to promote my movie? “Son of a bee sting!”

Now clearly part of the reason why this works so well for Anchorman 2 is the appeal and humor of Will Ferrell. And it seems Ferrell revels in the gag of staying in character.

Still, these partnerships provide a clever template for engaging and delighting consumers on a humorous and unexpected level while creating the proverbial “win-win.” “They've done studies, you know. And 60% of the time, this works every time.”","This Ron Burgundy ad is kind of a big deal.","2013-12-19 09:39:03"

The greatest gift a community manager can wish for during the holiday season is actually having ""time off."" While it's a lofty wish for a job that's always on, there are steps you can take to set you and your team up for as much cheer-filled free time as possible.

<strong>Content Calendar</strong>
Prepare a plan that shows what content is to be shared daily via each social media channel. Ideally you should have this year round, but it helps to get really granular while away. The less time you have to spend thinking up content while out of the office the better.

Go a step further and print this calendar out. Sure, it's on your computer, but you're not likely to be at a computer while trying to spend time with family and friends. Having a print out will allow you to quickly refer to it when needed, and also stay on top of posting times and potential high-volume comment periods.

A few notes about content:
<strong>Hours</strong>
If you manage a client with special holiday hours, post this information before someone asks for it. You'll be doing yourself and your community a favor.

<strong>Messaging</strong>
Take a deep breath and repeat after me: IT'S OKAY TO POST NOTHING ABOUT A HOLIDAY. Really, it is. The brand you manage does not have to comment on everything. That being said, most brands do like to say *something*. Before you say that something, make sure it is on point. Maybe your client does not want you to say ""Christmas."" Maybe they really do.

<strong>Passwords</strong>
Make sure you have a list of ALL social logins before you leave the office. Believe me, someone's going to make an epic rant on that blog Chrome conveniently forgets the login for. A simple list of passwords can save you some headaches. To save yourself from major headaches, make the list a little cryptic. Instead of @INSIDECURRENT TWITTER ACCOUNT PASSWORD ****** label it in terms only you'd understand, ex. ""C:T:****""

<strong>Scheduling</strong>
Schedule your Tweets and Facebook posts. Unfortunately, Instagram posts have to be done on the spot and Pinterest pins have to be pinned in the moment. When you have to post on social networks without a scheduling feature, it's helpful to set reminders on your phone. Go a step further and drop the content into the reminder so all you will have to do is cut and paste. This will also reduce the likelihood for typos.

<strong>Monitoring</strong>
Many consumers spend extra time on social networks during the holidays. This is a crucial point to keep in mind and quite frankly something you just have to accept. If you truly want holidays off maybe a role in social media is not for you.

Of course, brand social chatter can vary wildly by the nature of a business. You can probably make a good estimate of this beforehand. In our department, for example, we know which of our clients are likely to have lots of chatter and which will probably not receive so much as a mention. Regardless, we know this and prepare ourselves for it.

<strong>Responding</strong>
If you have multiple team members, you can divide up the monitoring by day or enact a ""whoever sees it first"" policy. Note: this only works if it doesn't become too one sided, but hopefully you can trust your team with this one.

<strong>Explain Yourself</strong>
If you're going to be monitoring while around family and friends, make sure to communicate that you may have to step away for a moment or you may be looking at your phone every now and again. I've since figured out that many assume because it's Christmas Day or (WHATEVER) holiday, they assume you are ""off."" Politely explaining the situation beforehand can help alleviate the pain of disgruntled relatives who assume you're playing Candy Crush rather than chatting with them about the latest family gossip.

<strong>Enjoy the Merry Merry</strong>
Remember, trolls will be trolls. Don't let them be the Grinch That Stole Christmas. If you encounter bad seeds simply approach them like the rockstar you are then quickly get back to drinking that Eggnog. Finding clarity in the offline moments will do nothing but set you up for mental success in the new year.

Have a great one, y'all.","Managing Social Media During Holidays #HowTo","2013-12-20 16:30:10"

Every year, new and innovative technology floods the scene. Unfortunately, the hype dies down after a while and we wait for the next big thing. I’ve learned a bit about Google Glass, as my professor uses it during technology and I personally have no idea what’s next. Although Google Glass is pretty nifty, lightweight, and wearable, I only question the future of the device. What will they do to improve it? Will there be anything done to perhaps even out the asymmetrical look? I personally don’t like how it’s one side holding the battery, CPU, camera and prism.

For quite some time, I was really not into the idea of Google Glass. I’m very into mobile devices, just not so much on wearable technology. Until UofL opened my eyes-literally-to something different. On November 9, UofL had their home-opener game against College of Charleston. Prior to the game, there was a national championship celebration that recapped the championship game and unveiled the 2013 banner.

A video took storm after this game, why? Because a new perspective was brought to the fans and the team. Number 11, Luke Hancock aka LUUUUUUUUUUUKE, wore Google Glass as part of “The Google Glass Experience.” The video opens with him warming up on the court-while wearing Google Glass! Once you get over the initial motion sickness of how much Luke moves around, things become more clear. The picture quality is great and the sound is on point. You can hear everything he says and what others around him says. Later in the video, you get a double screen of what he’s seeing and what was shown on the jumbotron.

My opinion changed completely on Google Glass after watching this. The ways you can use it are limitless. It’s amazing to be on the court with basketball players and see what they see. And, the entire video Luke Hancock keeps saying he is wearing secret agent glasses...that’s pretty fun. If you haven’t seen the video, I highly recommend you <a href=""http://cardinalathleticfund.com/google-glass.html"" target=""_blank"">check it out here.</a> I will warn you: it does take getting used to because there is a lot of movement.","Wearable technology: hot or not?","2014-01-06 15:12:41"

Who knew toilets and clogged drains could be sexy? Looks like the Liquid Plumr marketing team knows, and is following up its innuendo-filled, sexually charged <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_WkbC4lh4k"" target=""_blank"">“Double Impact</a>” and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st38kkyYjf0"" target=""_blank"">“Need it Now”</a> TV spots with a 2014 calendar dedicated to, you guessed it, sexy plumbers! The hot calendar definitely appeals to the anti-clog, drain-cleaning company’s female consumers, including myself. And if you’re in the market for a sexy, yet work-friendly calendar to hang on your office walls, Liquid Plumbr is offering up a quite studly alternative.

So not only does the calendar show guy eye-candy but it also shows a different Liquid Plumr product on every page. Each month also features a hunky model-plumber with centerfold stats and a short piece of copy on plumbing care. The hot calendar isn't just steamy because of the pectorally blessed babes on the pages, there are also various inappropriate innuendos. For instance, Mr. January likes quickies, and by that he means quickly cleaning clogged drains. Mr. June talks about the virtues of deep penetration, when it comes to unclogging, and Mr. May's guilty pleasure is sticky buns.

So although chemical drain openers and sexy don’t typically go hand in hand for most people, Liquid Plumr seems to mesh them seamlessly. <a href=""http://www.liquidplumr.com/pdf/LiquidPlumr_Calendar.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Download</a> your own copy here and see if you agree with me.","Meet the Liquid Plumr Hunks","2014-01-13 12:45:22"

As one of the folks here at Current360 who works on new business, I read with interest the latest white paper that the 4A’s issued regarding Agency Selection Briefing Guidance.

We are pleased and thankful to be routinely included in agency searches and RFPs.  New business is the lifeblood of any Ad Agency and a tremendous amount of effort, emotion and expense goes into its pursuit.

However, not all RFP’s are created equal – far from it. Unfortunately, we frequently see agency briefings that are poorly conceived, offer inadequate information, lack clear objectives, budget guidance or a realistic timeframe for response. Many of these inadequate briefings originate from great brands and clients with whom we would be passionate about working for. So we proceed.  And often we succeed despite the brief. But was it the best it could be?

So while poorly executed briefs are frustrating, time consuming and limiting for agencies, the ultimate loser are the clients themselves.  A poor RFP often results in “garbage in, garbage out,” a less than adequate understanding of a potential partner’s true value and ultimately leads to weak results and campaign ROI.

So in the spirit of a more successful RFP process for all parties, below are a few of the key recommendations for marketers from the 4A’s white paper. Cheers to more efficiency and effectiveness!

The ANA/4A’s task force believes that every phase of a review, or agency search, requires a thoughtful briefing that provides specific direction to the agency. The review process should provide escalating information to the agencies as the review progresses from the initial phases (e.g., RFI, RFP, credentials) to the later phases (including any strategic and/or speculative work and finals presentations).

<strong>Request for Information</strong>

The white paper suggests marketers ""share enough information about the search and your expectations as a client to allow the agencies to make an informed decision about whether this is a good fit.""

Marketers who skip the RFI stage and jump straight to the request for proposal – especially if they're considering a long list of agencies – risk wasting resources for all involved through evaluating Agencies that are not qualified.

<strong>Request for Proposal and Semi-Finals</strong>

Clients should think of the RFP as an opportunity to learn which agencies they want to include in their list of finalists, after selecting the best-qualified candidates. The RFP process should clarify the client’s expectations, and provide assurances that the agencies can handle the project/assignment.

Semi-finalist meetings are most productive when they take place in the agency’s office so that the client can get a true sense of the agency’s culture.

<strong>Finals</strong>

In the final phase a client is ideally evaluating only two or three agencies and should include briefings and in-person meetings, according to the guidelines.

Clients will often ask agencies to do real speculative work at this stage, which can be costly and time-consuming. To get the most out of the request, clients should schedule work sessions prior to the final presentation. It's also worth considering offering a token stipend to partially offset an agency's cost of participating in the process.

From this point on in this Ruby on Rails Custom CMS series I will be dividing up my blogs on a chapter-by-chapter basis.

Unfortunately, that means this one is going to be brief. I had already previously installed and configured Ruby, Rails, Ruby Version Manager, Homebrew and the majority of the other components that the majority of this chapter focuses on.

One thing I would suggest before you dive into this chapter is to sign up for free accounts at <a href=""https://github.com/"" target=""_blank"">GitHub</a>, which is used for version control and <a href=""https://www.heroku.com/"" target=""_blank"">Heroku</a> which is a Ruby application hosting service. Also, if you are planning on developing on a Mac install at a minimum XCode’s command line tools, if not the entire IDE. Signing up and installing these tools first will allow to go straight through the tutorial without having to stop and take care of these steps.

As I stated earlier I had already installed and configured my RoR setup before completing this chapter so it all went rather smoothly for me. The one thing that I did run across in this chapter was I did have to precompile my visual elements. This is covered in the chapter as something that is somewhat common as far as an additional step.

If you run across problems and can’t get them solved feel free to post them in the comments and I’ll try to help you out.","Ruby on Rails Chapter 1: From Zero to Deploy","2014-01-23 09:08:09"

With the tax filing deadline just weeks away, an audit is the last thing your business wants to contemplate. However, unlike the anxiety-inducing examination of your tax returns, an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) audit is a valuable tool for improving your website’s visibility and viability as a marketing tool, lead generator, and revenue stream.

The simple truth is, that unless your business’ taxes were prepared by the Statue of Liberty-costumed sign twirler outside the tax preparer’s office instead of the CPAs inside, your business has little to fear from a tax audit. In fact, your business is more likely to be in violation of SEO best practices than federal tax laws.

So will your website be shipped off to some white collar country club prison where it will be subjected to dial-up conditions and 800 x 600 screen resolution? No, the penalty is much worse. Just this week, Expedia was been penalized for posting the keywords “cheap flights” on external sites like travel blogs resulting in a 25% drop in its page rankings for travel-related searches. That’s more than a half-million searches!

<strong>Elements of an SEO audit include:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Benchmarking your business’ current digital presence</li>
	<li>Comparison against your competition’s digital presence</li>
	<li>Evaluation of how accessible and appareling your website is to the search engines</li>
	<li>Identification of penalties your website is currently experiencing</li>
	<li>Review of your on page-optimization</li>
	<li>Discovery of linking opportunities</li>
	<li>Inspection of business profile across search engines, directories and applications</li>

As we’re now into the beginning of the 2014 year…it’s only natural to look back on the good and the bad of 2013. Well, thanks to <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/contributor/tim-nudd"" target=""_blank"">Tim Nudd of AdWeek</a>…we can all enjoy a countdown of the worst <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/25-biggest-brand-fails-2013-154633#hoy-trial-lawyers-25"" target=""_blank"">25 brand fails in 2013</a>. From poor casting to painfully misguided creative direction, distasteful copywriting, social media meltdowns, and massive business blunders…2013 had it all.

Flipping through this catastrophic countdown, one must wonder how these campaigns we made it from a concept in the conference room out into the public without any internal team member (or client) taking a step back to analyze them objectively.

Stop. Think. Look at it with fresh eyes. Does it still make sense? Is it the right thing for the brand? Will it offend or alienate our target market (or <i>anyone</i> for that matter)?

Furthermore, the social media train wrecks are a fantastic reminder as to how permanent and public a company’s social media post is and how quickly a backlash wildfire can spread due to poor taste or bad judgment. An individual associated with a brand can easily crumble years of hard work establishing a strong brand with a quick a digital mutter of a not-so-clever comment (even though it sounded hilarious in their head).  Social Media has come to the forefront of brands’ consumer relations, and it is imperative that we treat seemingly impersonal dialogue via digital platforms with the care and consideration of in-person conversation.

Anyway…I enjoyed reliving 2013’s brand blooper reel…I hope you do too. Thanks, Tim Nudd for putting this list together.","Brand Fails in 2013","2014-01-30 13:30:36"

Listing 2.3

This graphic along with the text above and below it helps explain the functionality of the controller

There are more actions than corresponding pages that are rendered by the browser

Index, show, new, and edit correspond to pages rendered

This is process of actions is know as the REST architecture – explained in box 2.2

This chapter focuses on using Scaffoldings to get an upper-level overview of how RoR works.

The Micropost data set uses the ID from the User data set to associate the post to the user

The inheritance that is available by associating our data model with ActiveRecord is very powerful
By allowing for inheritance you can associate all basic RESTful actions to all Models simply and easily.

<strong>Scaffolding is not good for production level code. It is only used to get an overview of what is happening from a code standpoint. It is cluttered code.</strong>

There is always a level of excitement around C360 on Fridays. You would think everyone would be exhausted from the 4 days prior and the incredible pace we keep. One person described us as “gazelles.” Even with over 40 people working here, we still move very swift. And that in itself generates an electric vibe that keeps us coming back for more.

The variety of the work has a lot to do with why we love what we do and the energy people feel when they come into our place. Personally, I think we are all A.D.D. (I know I am) and this business just feeds our personality type because we are always moving from one thing to the next, often in 15 to 30 minute intervals.

So, Friday is the end? Ok not really but it is the time when we all start to see the light and think about how much we are going to enjoy our weekend. And the party often starts at our place on Fridays at 4:30pm when our president, Nick Ising, makes sure the fridge has ice cold beers and whips up some special margaritas. It’s great to sit around with everyone and shoot the breeze. And to know that several of our folks hang out together even on the weekends. TGIF!","Fridays at C360","2014-02-27 09:43:56"

For those of you born since our Agency was founded in 1984, let me start by educating you about the band known as Steppenwolf.  According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(band)"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a>, they were a rock group formed in late 1967.  They had 8 gold albums (yes, vinyl) and six top forty hits, the most popular of which was “Born to be Wild.”

Which could be useful in summing up the current state of marketing and messaging.

Legacy media, specifically newspaper magazines and telephone directories, still cling to life, though in a declining, greatly diminished and fractured state, with increasingly more attention paid to their “digital platforms” than their paper/printed products.

Persistent media, radio and television, increasingly tout the ability to be “breaking news” via Twitter and Facebook or to listen/watch via satellite or online.

Emerging media, which has in fact already emerged, is the new frontier and is ever expanding/refining means to target consumers with messages they seek, wherever they are, through:
<ul>
	<li>SEO</li>
	<li>Google Adwords</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>YouTube</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>Pinterest</li>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Vine</li>
	<li>SnapChat</li>
</ul>
and on and on.

Today’s reality—and genesis of The Steppenwolf Theory—is that there are more marketing/media “guns” than ever before.  What would happen if we used them all to their maximum extent?

As the first verse of their most popular hit has it:

<em>“Get your motor runnin'</em>
<em>Head out on the highway</em>
<em>Lookin' for adventure</em>
<em>And whatever comes our way</em>
<em>Yeah Darlin' go make it happen</em>
<em>Take the world in a love embrace</em>
<em>Fire all of your guns at once</em>
<em>And explode into space.”</em>","The Steppenwolf Theory","2014-03-06 09:21:19"

Thirty-one years ago a four-year-old Mark Neu tuned into the “Dream Game.” This week the NCAA basketball tournament gods have once again brought us, what some are calling, “Dream Game II.”  The original dream game—played in 1983—featured Louisville and Kentucky men’s basketball teams—a matchup that hadn’t gone head-to-head in twenty-four years. I was able to harness the power of YouTube and look back at the interviews of Coach Crum and Coach Hall along with all the media hype that fueled even greater during this basketball rivalry.

Now, flash forward to the year 2014. Louisville and Kentucky play the annual “Battle of the Bluegrass” and have most recently met in the NCAA Tournament during the 2012 Final Four. Though familiarity now exists between the basketball teams, the flames of this historic rivalry remain white hot.

I believe in the power of incorporating sports marketing as a part of a marketer’s annual advertising plan. When done correctly, an advertiser’s brand can tap into the raw emotion of a local team’s fan base. However, as the paying advertiser, you need to control either the allegiance or distain felt for the team with which you are looking to align your brand.

This week, I have been bombarded with advertising packages to align my clients’ brands with Friday night’s “Dream Game” sequel.  While I—a HUGE sports fan—have bought into the media hype, I’m hesitant to purchase television or radio packages for my clients. Yes, the television rating for this game is going to be tremendous, but not as great as one might think. I’ll even go on the record and predict that the HH rating for this game will be at a 49. As a reference point, even with the NCAA National Championship game played on a Monday night, the 2013 Louisville national championship achieved a 54 and the UK national championship achieved a 51. One little wrinkle to the rating this time around is that the “Dream Game II“ will be played on Friday night.  And, since this game will kickoff the weekend, I’m predicting many fans will be viewing it at their favorite local watering hole—for which viewership is not calculated into the rating.

The packages that I have been presented are at a substantial cost, rightfully so, due to both the increased viewership and listenership. However, I cannot justify expenditure for this one-time event. The package costs that have come across my desk would allow any of my local advertisers the opportunity to place approximately a quarter’s worth of spots on that particular station. Though this thought process flies in the face of brands’ advertising during the Super Bowl, keeping perspective for my local clients is key.  Bud Light, GoDaddy.com, Coke and Pepsi’s budgets are 1000x greater than any of my local clients with a goal to reach the masses branding new product launches.

My local advertisers need to concentrate on more immediate ROI because advertising during one basketball game, no matter how important to both fan bases, will not achieve long-term sales growth. Therefore, I implore local advertisers to get caught up in the hype as a fan but be cautious with their advertising dollars.","March Madness Marketing Trap?","2014-03-26 14:51:06"

The more wireframes I build for projects, the more one thing becomes clear; there is no hard and fast answer as to what level of fidelity is best. This is probably due to the fact that wireframes can serve multiple purposes. That being said, I prefer to develop medium to high fidelity wireframes. They work better for our process here at C360 for several reasons;

<b>1) They keep the client engaged in the process from the very beginning.</b> Particularly on smaller projects, I tend to lean more towards a high fidelity approach. In my experience this alleviates some of the desire from the client to see a design first thing. Provided that it is clearly communicated to them that the wireframe is not the final product, it offers opportunity for the client to give some design feedback without frustrating the designer. This can save valuable time further down the project's timeline once the research has been done and it IS time to push pixels in Photoshop. That is - if you still do Photoshop mockups - I do.

<b>2) They lend insight to a site's content structure.</b> Without displaying the complete content of pages, a wireframe can convey a sense of ""everything having its place."" To that end, I like to include the titles of subsections of pages so the client - and team - get a better idea of what will live on the page, rather than just the top level category.

<b>3) Higher fidelity wireframes help with estimating the cost of a project.</b> Staring at a sitemap does little to help everyone grasp the enormity of a project, or in some cases, just how simple a solution may be. By expanding upon the sitemap with a high fidelity wireframe, the needs of the project and methods of execution begin to come into focus. This allows our team to have firmer grasp on the tasks at hand and are able to deliver a more accurate estimate.

<b>4) Depending on your weapon of choice, iterating can be much faster.</b> I prefer Illustrator for developing wireframes. Photoshop overly complicates things and distracts from the task at hand. (This is a pretty subjective one, but I personally can work much, much faster in Illustrator than anything else I have come across to date).

So there are a few examples. Opinions vary, which to me says that its a matter of works best for you, your team and - more importantly - your project.","Wireframes: High, Low, or Medium-ish Fidelity?","2014-04-01 08:06:49"

“Boundaries for Leaders” caught my eye in the bookstore. I'm always looking for tidbits of information on how to best lead and influence our culture, then share it  with the new leaders in our company. However, the word “boundaries” often has a negative connotation associated with it. So I was curious to see how boundaries could be used by a leader in a positive way.

Henry writes, “A boundary is a structure that determines what will exist and what will not.”

Hmm. Still doesn’t sound too positive to me. Structure? Boundary? Just not the words that make me envision employees ﬁlled with joy at work.

When I read further, I realized that setting boundaries is really about accountability and managing time better. Plus creating a positive, energetic and innovative work environment by deciding what is going to be allowed and what is not. At every level.

For example, we've built into our daily plan something called, “Groove time.” From 9:30a.m. to noon each day it's a time where all of us can focus—with minimal interruptions—and refrain from meetings. We decided we’re most creative in the morning and to use this time of day for more focused attention to work. It’s been a really positive “boundary,” and we honor it with few exceptions, like client-requested meetings or photo/video shoots.

Dr. Cloud contends that, ""Our brains need to be able to: (a) Focus on something speciﬁc, (b) Avoid getting off track by other data inputs or toxicity, and (c) continuously be aware of relevant information at all times.""

He calls this part “working memory.” It’s basically memory retention that you continue to build upon. Dr. Cloud also talks about how multi-tasking is overrated. He says we should, “attend to what is relevant and inhibit anything else.”

One question in the book that I don’t think a lot of business owners consider is, “Have you ever thought about how your people feel at work? You better.”

I am such a “feeling” person so I am constantly checking on my co-workers. What is their mood like? Are they feeling okay today? Are they stressed out and looking like a dear in the headlights? Is there something I can say or do to help them have a better day in the ofﬁce? Unfortunately, I know some leaders that really don’t care how their folks are feeling about their jobs. I think they would say, “They are lucky to have a job.” or “It’s called work for a reason.” And I’m also betting these places have a lot of turnover—which is expensive if you’re constantly training new people. Plus, that “working memory” and retention of relevant information walks out the door with the employee.

Having strong interpersonal skills is so important if you have people working for you. You have to build a culture of trust and integrity. And be “ridiculously in charge.” Dr. Cloud says to “own it and create the culture you want.”

One of the prevailing trends in marketing is a resurgence of sincerity. Instead of focusing on individual product attributes or price comparisons, more brands are moving toward an honest, softer, more personable approach to establish an active relationship with potential customers. This is likely due to the majority of millennials arriving into adulthood and the buying power they now represent.

Over the years, these younger consumers have been categorized by several defining demographic traits: They are more tech savvy than older generations and enjoy being hyper-connected with the world around them. Many tend to be highly ambitious (some would even say narcissistic) in their personal lives and careers. They truly care about social and environmental issues. And they prefer authenticity and realness when engaging with brands.

That last attribute may be the biggest game-changer, as it has actually begun to transcend generational ideologies. Now Gen X and Baby Boomers – groups that had grown accustomed to years of hard selling – are appreciating and responding to the same sincere, personal messaging preferred by millennials.

By understanding how this approach can appeal to multiple audiences, agencies are able to establish strong relationships between clients and consumers. This proved to be true during our recent rebranding efforts for Clark Memorial Hospital.

We wanted to convey that residents of Southern Indiana could expect high-quality healthcare from a hospital that truly cares about their needs, along with the needs of their family members, their neighbors and their overall community.

To create a human connection, we took a closer look into the motivations of former patients and current providers. We wanted to know – with all the healthcare options available in the area – why they chose Clark. So we conducted interviews, hoping to uncover a few heartwarming stories that we could build a campaign around.

Fortunately, Clark Memorial already has a strong reputation for exceptional healthcare. We were told story after story of staff members going above the call of duty, parents returning for the births of their second and third children and physicians taking pride in offering the latest treatment options so that their patients wouldn’t be forced to leave the community.

The consistency in which we heard about these positive experiences made us comfortable that the concept reflected the true personality of the hospital. We also knew that we would have more than enough material to continue the campaign for years.

For our marketing executions, we simply retold these stories and featured the actual patients and physicians in their own environments. And this strategy is resonating among residents of Southern Indiana. They are now identifying Clark Memorial as their community’s hospital of choice. Of course, they also enjoy recognizing their friends and neighbors from the various campaign materials.

Ultimately, with members of the target audience supplying content, testimonials can be less complicated than creating an original campaign from scratch. But there is a catch: The messaging must be sincere. Today’s consumers – of all ages – can immediately detect manufactured emotion and will tune out brands they perceive as fake or dishonest.

When executed correctly, incorporating sincerity, authenticity and honesty makes it possible to appeal to multiple generations and build a strong, personal relationship between a brand and the people they want to reach.

Here's an example of how we’ve utilized this strategy for Clark Memorial Hospital:

<em><strong>What animal would win in a fight between a tiger and a gorilla?</strong></em>

This was the topic of discussion during today’s lunch at our agency’s studio table.

After much debate and discussion—considering the size, strength, weight and abilities of each animal (e.g. claws vs. opposable thumbs)—the table was at a stalemate. There’s no doubt both animals are at the top of the food chain, having no known predators in the wild.

Though neither side could persuade the other on who would win the hypothetical battle between these formidable creatures, I started to think, “What if a predator had the capabilities of both animals? A super predator. A tigerilla. Since both are respectively dangerous, joining their capabilities and strengths would compound into an elite fury they could inflict on their prey.”

Now before you dismiss this discussion as some outlandish plot to a low-budget, sci-fi film, allow me to present it in a different way. Who is your cable provider? Based on market share trends, I would venture to guess either Comcast® or Time Warner Cable® given that Time Warner is the second largest cable company in the U.S. behind Comcast.

Time Warner—the “tiger” of the cable industry—has pounced on all its competition with great ferocity and rules its various territories in a carnivorous manner.

Comcast—the “gorilla” of the cable industry—has effectively bullied all competition out of its territories and wrestled its consumers into submission.

What could be worse than these two industry animals operating separately in their respective territories?<b> </b>A<i> </i>merger that would create a near monopoly of one super-company controlling over two-thirds of the cable market.<b></b>

This could be a reality as Comcast has officially filed a 180-page <a href=""http://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/comcast_twc_public-interest-statement_redacted-4-08-14-sec-legend.pdf"">document</a> to the Federal Communications Commission for a Comcast/TWC merger. Many writers, critics, public interest groups and consumers are already voicing their objections. A petition has been drafted that currently has 400,000 signatures and letters have been sent to the FCC and Department of Justice urging government officials to reject the proposed unification of powerful companies.

Ellen Stutzman, Director of Research and Public Policy at the Writers Guild of America, raised the worrisome topic of media and content censorship power in saying, “It’s anti-competitive and it’s a bad deal for content creators as well as consumers…allowing them to get bigger by acquiring 8 or 10 million new customers will make them too powerful of a content gatekeeper.”<a href=""http://consumerist.com/2014/03/27/sen-franken-calls-comcasttime-warner-cable-merger-a-terrible-deal-for-consumers/"" target=""_blank"">[i]</a>

Chris Meyer, Vice President of External Affairs for Consumers Union, addresses the existing low customer satisfaction of the two companies and goes further to encourage readers to voice their opinions and sign the petition to reject the merger in his article,<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-meyer/i-want-a-bigger-cable-com_b_5154069.html"" target=""_blank""> <i>I Want A Bigger Cable Company, Said No One Ever</i><i>.[ii]</i></a>

I’m frightened of the power this “tigerilla” could wield if these two cable-industry animals continue to gain strength through a merger. If they already prey on consumers as individual companies (as many of their customers can attest to), what will happen once they join forces and eliminate even more competition in the cable market?

Higher cable or internet prices? Even worse customer service? One entity having unprecedented control over programming?

It’s an unsettling thought, and this is exactly why we have federal regulatory agencies in place. Let’s just hope our government sides with the people it serves and prevents the cable-industry “tigerilla” from preying on us little folks.","The Animal Kingdom of the Cable Industry","2014-04-25 14:20:27"

Hopefully you were not holding your breath waiting on me to post the follow up to <a href=""http://current360.com/play/ruby-on-rails-chapter-1-from-zero-to-deploy/"" target=""_blank"">my last blog</a> about Ruby on Rails.

This chapter runs you through some basic Rails commands to get an upper level view of how the language and extensions work together. You also get introduced to the different states or environments of a RoR (Ruby on Rails) application. With a default setup of a RoR application you have at least 2 states: production and development.

Production - is a fully functional (hopefully thoroughly tested) version of your application.

Development  - is what its name says. Still under development. This could be for your first release or the latest and greatest update to any application.

This is one of the first things I noticed as I was reading through the chapter before jumping into coding. You can see the different environments in the Gemfile in Listing 2.1.

The listing shows that in the production environment we are using:

gem 'pg', '0.15.1'

While in the development environment we are using:

gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.8'

What does this mean exactly?

Those are two different database (DB) gems that are available for RoR applications. While we are developing we are using a <a href=""https://sqlite.org/"" target=""_blank"">simpler DB in SQLite</a>. It is easier to install and implement — with the caveat that it is much less powerful than <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/."" target=""_blank"">PostgreSQL</a>.

I’m not going into more detail here. The important thing to note is that the environments are different and you want to make sure you are altering the correct environment when you are developing your application.

The next thing I noticed was the tutorial used a Scaffolding to show an upper-level overview of how RoR functions.2 I suggest spending an ample amount of time reviewing Listing 2.3 and the text that immediately before and after it. This section <a href=""http://current360.com/play/ruby-on-rails-the-beginning/"" target=""_blank"">thoroughly explains the MVC process</a> and how to use it in an RoR application.3

This section first introduces you to inheritance in RoR and all of its wonderful powers. The MicroPost data inherits the RESTful actions that are available through <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.orghtml"" target=""_blank"">ActiveRecord</a>. This allows us to map the different actions, such as create, edit, destroy, update, etc in Lisiting 2.3 with its corresponding URL. Ex.) <a href=""http://yoururl.com/users/edit"">yourURL.com/users/edit</a>

Hopefully this chapter went pretty well for you as it is fundamental building blocks of what is coming next.

—

1. Personally, I would advise making your production and development environments identical to avoid any potential issues that may arise during the process of altering your application into your production environment.

2. Scaffolding is not good for production level code.  It is bloated code that would potentially effect performance in a production environment.

3. I did not have a good understanding of how MVC worked when I first started and it was a significant hindrance to my progress.","Ruby on Rails Chapter 2: A Demo App","2014-04-30 14:39:27"

I confess. My dogs made me buy a new car. Although they weren’t telepathically speaking to me about “end-of-the-year clearance events” and “dealer incentives,” they were giving me the “are you kidding us?” look of disbelief every morning as I attempted to load them into the back seat of a two-door coupe through an eight-inch, wedge-shaped opening. Yes, it was time for this daddy to get a four-door vehicle.

I wanted to remain brand loyal to Nissan, and despite being 50 (or perhaps because I am 50), I wanted to drive something that seemed a bit unconventional and youthful. The Juke seemed to be just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, the Juke’s funky, eye-catching exterior conceals an interior inspired by Barbie’s dream car complete with a shiny plastic, candy-apple red console and accents throughout. Even in gray, the overuse of plastic in $30,000 vehicle was a turnoff.

Next, I test drove a Mazda CX-5 and nearly fell asleep at the wheel. Although it features a smooth ride and luxurious interior, I felt as though I was driving my parents’ car.

My next stop was the Mini dealership. As I entered the showroom, I could feel my heart begin to race as I saw all the sporty, uniquely designed models on display. Everything in the showroom seemed to scream fun, individuality and design. And, to prove that they’re more than bright colors and hip designs, their displays, collateral materials and especially the test drive illustrated that the Mini has a rich history of and commitment to performance.

I was sold. And so began my indoctrination into the Mini family…I mean cult. Over the last few months, I have become a rabid brand advocate. My Mini Countryman’s photo is one of almost 3.5 million Mini-tagged photos on Instagram. I am one of the brand’s almost 4 million Facebook fans and 98,000 Twitter followers.

So what is it about Mini that makes its drivers so passionate? First and foremost, it’s a great car. Mini has received the J.D. Power “Highest in Sales Satisfaction among Mass Market Brands” honor four years in a row. But as a branding professional, what appeals most to me is their consumer engagement and success as a lifestyle brand. Since my purchase, I have received:
<ul>
	<li>A complimentary subscription to their lifestyle magazine featuring the coolest hipsters on the planet doing stuff you can only dream about…and hey look, they have a Mini, too</li>
	<li>An invitation to attend a hands-on driving school at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway</li>
	<li>A catalog promoting the “You-ification” of my car with more than 10 million possible design combinations</li>
	<li>Encouragement to name my car and register the moniker online</li>
	<li>A Mini backpack with a Mini-USB thumb drive, journal, pen and more</li>
	<li>An offer to help find a volunteer opportunity that matches my interests (MotoringHearts.com)</li>
	<li>Membership in an online owners’ lounge (community forum)</li>
</ul>
Just like fingerprints and snowflakes, we are conditioned to believe that minis and their owners are unique and special.

Several of our bulbs attended the ""What is UX?"" event presented by information architect and user experience designer Rick Spencer.

Here are a couple of highlights:

<strong>UX stands for User Experience.</strong>

Many people have the misconception that UX and UI (User Interface) are synonyms.
<ul>
	<li>UX is the emotional reaction the user has during and after using the website or application.</li>
	<li>UI is how the user physically interacts with the website or application.</li>
</ul>
This means you can have the most beautifully designed UI with every pixel painstakingly poured over and in the perfect place, but if I click the “Buy Now” button and it takes me to the “About Us” page my UX with the product is poor.

This is because the user’s expectation was to begin the process of purchasing something but instead was taken to a completely different page causing frustration and distrust in the site. Most likely, the user has now lost interest in completing the purchase. You don’t have to be tech-savvy to see the problem here.

<strong>It is vital to manage the expectations of the end user.</strong>

User expectations will vary based on their level of comfort with the product they’re using. More experienced users have more defined expectations. If you don’t meet their expectations, then they will quickly stop interacting with your product and go elsewhere.

Inexperienced users will have fewer expectations but a greater level of trepidation when interacting with your product. For these users, intuitive actions are necessary.

The fear in these users gives us a great opportunity. For instance, an inexperienced user is filing their taxes online for the first time. If each question is easy to comprehend, presented to them in a logical order and leads to a completed tax form, then you have crafted a great UX. And the likelihood that the user is going to use your product next tax season is very high.

<strong>The Double Diamond</strong>

Every person that attended the event made some mention of a double diamond illustration that was referenced throughout.

<a href=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DoubleDiamond_580.jpg""><img alt=""DoubleDiamond_580"" src=""http://current360.com/play/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DoubleDiamond_580.jpg"" width=""580"" height=""367"" /></a>

It’s a workflow process. As much information as possible is gathered, reviewed, digested and refined before any decisions on implementation are made, executed and delivered.

In the marketing industry, it’s easy to get wrapped up in projects that go from an introductory meeting straight into design with little or no initial research. But research is critical. It’s hard to sell someone something they don’t understand. So, spending the extra time and dollars on initial research can have a huge return on your SEO, ROI and also your UX.

The “What is UX?” event sparked a lot of internal discussions about how we can best implement UX in every project at Current360, and we were lucky to have attended it while in the process of refining our workflow procedures. Even though the UX process is forever changing, we left feeling good knowing we’ve already been covering most aspects of the presentation in our current processes.","Our experience learning about the user experience","2014-05-20 08:49:18"

This weekend marked my 14th year as a Current360 employee. Fourteen years. I had to let that sink in for a bit. Bill Clinton was still president for a few more months, you could still take pocket knives on airplanes and Apple shares were trading in the 80s (FYI - today it opened at 633.00 a share).

Like most advertising agencies, things have changed in 14 years. Clients and coworkers have come and gone. Technology has evolved. (Remember zip discs?) Design trends have seemingly changed daily. But one thing that has remained constant at Current is music. Not necessarily in taste or trend, but in its presence.

Even dating back to the Story Avenue days, the designers at C360 have always worked in one big room. And music is always playing. So to celebrate 14 years, I thought I'd put together a playlist of 14 songs that remind me of the people at Current. Because in my day, that's what you did for people you loved—you made them a mix tape.

Fair warning: this is going to be all over the place. But I think that's sort of fitting for the cast of characters that has worked here over the years.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Top Jimmy - Van Halen</strong>
My first interview at Current was with Lisa, Allison and Dennis in the conference room of our old offices on Story Avenue. The first question they asked me wasn't about my resume or my portfolio. It was, ""If we hire you, can we call you Jimmy D?"" I had been ""Jim"" since middle school, but I really wanted the job, so I said, ""If you hire me, you can call me Susan."" I'm glad they stuck with Jimmy D.</li>
	<li><strong>Bit Part - The Lemonheads</strong>
One of the first things Dennis and I bonded over was our firm belief that ""It's a Shame About Ray"" makes for excellent road trip music.</li>
	<li><strong>Alison - Elvis Costello</strong>
This song was on heavy rotation in the old studio for a long time. And every time it played, our own Allison would say ""What a <em>GREAT</em> song!"" That still makes me laugh 14 years later.</li>
	<li><strong>What You Wish For - Guster</strong>
Our former coworker/resident movie critic Marcia Hogg became obsessed by the idea that the drummer from Guster played with his hands instead of sticks. It was a constant source of fascination for her.</li>
	<li><strong>Oceans - Pearl Jam</strong>
This one checks two boxes. Because our Interactive CD, Donovan Sears, is the biggest Pearl Jam fan I know and we used to have a designer named Ocean. Seriously. Ocean.</li>
	<li><strong>Black Hole Sun - Soundgarden</strong>
If you even get a chance, ask Chris Fosson about his high school-era fake Soundgarden cover band, Spiderella. (Not much to do in Flatwoods, I guess.)</li>
	<li><strong>Lights of Louisville - The Muckrakers</strong>
These guys were signed to Label X, who used to be a tenant in our building, and they played one of our Cocktails in the Courtyard parties. Still one of my favorite bands and a great bunch of guys.</li>
	<li><strong>Fish and Whistle - John Prine</strong>
This song reminds me of Nick Ising. Always has. Always will.</li>
	<li><strong>What's He Building in There - Tom Waits</strong>
Our radio in the studio is always on WFPK and every Halloween this song goes into heavy rotation. And it always make us laugh, because it drives Dennis nuts.</li>
	<li><strong>Generator (First Floor) - Freelance Whales</strong>
This is one of the many bands our former VP Katy Miller turned me on to. She and her husband Scott have a great record collection and great taste in music (even if they insist that Echo and the Bunnymen are better than The Smiths).</li>
	<li><strong>Young Folks - Peter, Bjorn and John</strong>
No song made us switch off the radio faster that when this was in heavy rotation on WFPK. Our distaste for this song was universal and intense. So much so, that it has become a part of our shared experience. Now, we can laugh about it, but in 2006...</li>
	<li><strong>You Make My Dreams - Hall &amp; Oates</strong>
There have been plenty of occasions where one of us has had to enlighten the Millennials about music that came out before 1995. (Explaining The White Album to a 20-something can be tougher than you would think.) But one place where we have come together is a love of the catchy pop tunes of Hall &amp; Oates.</li>
	<li><strong>Rosalinda's Eyes - Billy Joel</strong>
Former copywriter Steve Morgan and I shared a similarly timed obsession with old vinyl, especially deep tracks from early Billy Joel records.</li>
	<li><strong>Halo - Beyoncé</strong>
I don't know anything about Beyoncé's music. And I'm fine with that. But I know our newest hire, Maggie Ising (who was 7-years-old when I started this job), would never forgive me if there wasn't a little Queen Bey on this list.</li>

Hourly rates for the various services an agency provides have long been a sticking point for me. Hourly rates can create such a shell game; I just don’t understand why otherwise savvy clients want to get so granular with billing.

Those conversations usually go something like this:
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: What’s your hourly rate for copywriting?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Me</span>: Are you buying hours or are you buying solutions to a marketing problem?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: Don’t change the subject. I want to know what I’m getting for my money.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Me</span>: I understand, but that’s what I’m trying to tell you. You don’t want to pay for time; you want to pay for the idea, for the solution.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: But how do I know I’m not paying too much?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Me</span>: How do you know you’re not paying too little?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: Who’s on first?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Me</span>: Fair enough. Let’s try this: If I tell you the tactical solution to your $100,000 strategic problem will cost you, let’s say, $10,000. Will that seem fair?</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: A 10:1 return on my marketing investment? Sure, that’s fair.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Me</span>: So, it doesn’t really matter to you if our hourly rate is $80 and it takes us twelve-and-a-half hours; or if our hourly rate is $150 and it only takes us six-and-a-half hours? Your problem is still solved, right.</em></p>
<em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Client</span>: Ok, I think I see what you’re saying now.</em>

Unfortunately, not all of those conversations go like this. But it <i>is</i> true. Why would any businessperson put their top talent on a project, only to handcuff them with a discounted fee structure? If an agency is giving you discounted rates, make sure they’re not giving you discounted talent.

At Current360, we often spend so much of our days solving our clients’ marketing problems that we seldom have time to devote to our own. Back in January, we pulled some of our top minds out of the office for a day to work on <i>our</i> business. One of the 16 initiatives to come out of that retreat was to build into our client relations the idea of value pricing: Charging for solutions instead of hours.

Through our various memberships, we have access to national, regional and local agencies’ fees for various marketing solutions. Using this data, along with a sensible “what’s this worth to our client?” mentality, we are developing some value-based pricing solutions.

If you’ve known us long, you know the C360 Way of doing things is to give our clients a budget and stick to that budget. We also utilize not-to-exceed pricing. Our estimates are based on the time involved in a project.

The beauty of this approach is that it frees our people to solve the problem, not spend a specific amount of time on it. Certainly time spent is going to be important to the profitability of our company, but we believe in long-term relationships. And if the project takes more time, that's our investment in the client relationship.

If you’re a client, what would you rather buy from us: 10 hours at $200/hour, 20 hours at $150 or a great idea that solves your problem?

That’s what we think, too.","The Myth of Hourly Rates","2014-06-03 12:28:40"

While most businesses understand how to promote their content to consumers via “owned” social media channels, many are missing the opportunity to get their message in front of <strong>highly targeted audiences</strong> through paid social ads. On June 24th I had the honor of presenting the following to the <a href=""https://www.louisvilleadfed.org/"" target=""_BLANK"" rel=""nofollow"">Advertising Federation of Louisville</a> during a Lunch &amp; Learn.

In <strong><em>Using Social Insights To Fine Tune Your Advertising</em></strong>, we discussed how social media can be used to gain consumer insights and how those insights can be used to create <strong>targeted advertising</strong>. We walked through the latest options presented via paid social advertising on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and discussed targeting according to <strong>demographics, social connections, interests and habits on desktop and mobile devices.</strong>

Emojis—those little ideograms sent in electronic messages around the world—are quickly becoming very popular in the United States. Why are they so popular? Primarily because <strong>emojis allow us to digitally express emotions through the use of a single symbol instead of several words</strong>. As the pace of communication increases, they’ve become a handy little tool. And because acronyms are so 2012. So in honor of the new round of emojis set to debut in July 2014, we’ve recreated some of our favorites <em>IRL (In Real Life)</em>. We’ve taken some creative liberties but, for the most part, have tried to demonstrate how these little cartoons would translate in our world—with often a hilarious and awkward outcome.

If you haven’t visited the <a href=""http://www.fraziermuseum.org/"" target=""_BLANK"">Frazier History Museum</a> to see <a href=""http://www.fraziermuseum.org/gridiron-glory/"" target=""_BLANK"">Gridiron Glory – The Best of the Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> yet, go right now. Seriously. This blog will be here when you get back. Just get up, grab your keys and head toward West Main Street.

The exhibit – complete with 200 rare pro football artifacts and interactive displays – is just that good. There’s something for football and non-football fans of all ages. And it’s only in Louisville for a few months (the last day will be August 31<sup>st</sup>).

In the spirit of full disclosure, the Frazier History Museum is one of our clients at Current360. But I’m making this recommendation as someone who truly loves football. I’ve been multiple times, and I can’t stop telling friends, family members and random people on the street to go see it as well.

To help spread this message beyond the 19 people I know in Louisville, our agency created a dynamic television spot to stir the hearts of sports fans and their families.

Football is an emotional game. So our idea was to recreate the raw emotions a person experiences the first time they see a favorite player’s game-worn uniform, a relic from an unforgettable game played generations ago or the Vince Lombardi Super Bowl Trophy.

Of course, to achieve maximum effect, we also needed to show these reactions in ultra slo-mo with a soundtrack reminiscent of NFL Films and a John Facenda inspired voiceover.

The entire spot takes place within the exhibit space. With more than 5000 square feet of legendary football memorabilia and hands-on (<em>or feet-on</em>) displays to work with, it was a difficult task choosing which parts to include in the final 30-second cut.

We also complemented the television spot with a series of outdoor and digital executions that played on the accomplishments of several Pro Football Hall of Fame members that are featured at the exhibit. These showed the player’s jersey along with a clever headline. My personal favorite is a Franco Harris jersey with the line, “Immaculate Collection.” This speaks right to the heart of football fans.

Overall, this campaign was a lot of fun to work on. And being an actual member of the target audience certainly helped to fuel the creative spirit.

So, even though you didn’t just take my word for it at the beginning of this blog and blindly head toward the Frazier History Museum, I hope you will end up visiting Gridiron Glory – The Best of the Pro Football Hall of Fame before it concludes. From one football fan to another, it’s an experience you won’t soon forget.","Marketing for the love of the game","2014-07-07 12:42:56"

Long gone are the days of old-fashioned courting. A time when women would wait by the mailbox for a love letter or spend hours talking on their bedroom telephone. But does that mean romance is gone, too?

Just like phone calls were replaced by texts and letters were replaced by emails, marketing has become more and more impersonal.

As a copywriter, I spend a good portion of my week writing <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Current360"" target=""_BLANK"">Facebook</a>, Bing and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+Current360/posts"" target=""_BLANK"">Google</a> ads. But as a millennial consumer, I find myself looking for more of a personal relationship with the brands I love. Gimmicky “junk” mail, “spam” emails and pop-up ads don’t swoon me. Sometimes a girl just needs to be romanced.

I recently received a handwritten, personalized card from a fitness studio I often visit. The card read:
<blockquote><i>Brooke,
</i><i>Thanks for spending your Saturday morning shaking with me! Can’t wait to see you again soon! Hope you like the UK blue Kira Grace halter tank.</i><i>
</i><i>Xoxo,
</i><i>Stephanie</i></blockquote>
This pleasant surprise probably only took a couple minutes to write and mail, but it is a low-cost tactic with a high return. And it made enough of an impact that I felt the need to blog about it.

Granted, this is a local company and I’m already a loyal customer, but they have some serious competition in the city. So it’s strategic for a company—especially one that cashes in on referral visitors—to keep current customers happy.

This strategy can also work with larger brands. I’ve received a thank-you card for online purchases from big names as well. The key is to get to know your customers and keep it genuine. We ladies can always tell if a love note is actually cheesy song lyrics.

Here at Current360, we’re always using social media to help our clients connect to their loyal customers on a personal level. We will randomly send swag to fans of our wine accounts or give them a shout-outs through social media. These are the little things that help consumers—especially millennials—feel a true connection to a brand. And, as we know, a true connection can lead to a forever romance.

One of the most exciting things about working in advertising today is the fact that our messages can be distributed across so many different mediums. However, with these seemingly endless distribution formats and opportunities for creativity, comes the challenge of keeping up with the constantly evolving possibilities. At Current360, we confront this challenge with a monthly employee meeting called ""Spotlight.""

Spotlight is typically held over lunch. Everyone in the agency is invited to share noteworthy, cool and/or interesting articles, videos, campaigns, websites, apps and the list goes on. It's more than just an avenue for sharing, it also provides us with an opportunity to discuss how we can possibly apply these new ideas to our work as a way to benefit our clients.

If you'd like to see the types of things we share and discuss in Spotlight—and perhaps learn a few things in the process—check out a collection of our <a href=""http://bundlr.com/b/spotlight"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">most recent shares</a>.","Current Spotlight","2014-07-15 13:22:45"

<h2>Ruby on Rails Blog Series</h2>
Welcome back to our Ruby on Rails blog series. In this chapter we create some of the more “static” pages of our sample microbloging application. They aren’t truly static as they have some dynamic elements, but their functionality could mainly be accomplished through HTML.
<h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
We are also introduced to RSpec testing in this chapter, which is used throughout the remainder of the tutorial. RSpec is not the default-testing unit that comes with RoR. We use RSpec to create a testing unit that allows us to define what each section of our code is supposed to do. Run the tests, watch it fail, then alter the code until each test passes.  This allows us to be confident that our code is not only working, but also efficient.

Test driven development also will help you adhere to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle of keeping your code modular. The benefits of this are numerous. By writing the test before you write the code you ensure that once the tests pasts you are delivering all the functionality you originally set out to accomplish — assuming you wrote a complete test. Additionally if you go to extend your application in the future you need only to write the tests for the new functionality. You already know that the base functionality is complete — that is why we wrote the tests. Now you once you get the new functionality tests passing you have extended your application without the fear of breaking what you already had working in the past.

I found <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong> to be very rewarding. You write a spec for what behavior you expect, watch it fail, alter the code as necessary and watch it pass. This allows you to always feel as if you are accomplishing tasks and moving forward with your code.","Ruby on Rails Chapter 3: Test Driven Development","2014-07-23 13:30:58"

As the lazy days of summer begin to wind down, back-to-school sales begin to ramp up, and kids from California to Connecticut enjoy their last few days of adolescent irresponsibility. What will it be today?

Video selfies while lip-synching the soundtrack of <i>Frozen</i>? A homemade slip ‘n slide from trash bags and vegetable oil?  Or a trip to the mall to find just the right fragrance that says confidently, “I’m a 7<sup>th</sup> grader!”

Often during the summer, adults enjoy a lightened workload as well. And rather than using the downtime to create sales strategies, make client calls or refine sales skills, employees are easily distracted by Facebook updates, viral videos, online word games, and photo filters. <i>Can someone please explain to me when you would ever use the Kelvin filter?</i>

But just as kids must face a new school year, adults should have to brush up on their curriculum as well.
